# Advance the LIVE worktree the watchdog LaunchAgent runs from, to
# origin/main -- the half of #99 that nothing did. #100 built the report
# (`code: ... behind origin/main`); this is the deploy step that acts on it.
#
# WHO CALLS THIS: watchdog.sh, on the way out of every tick, whenever the copy
# running is the pinned live one -- and loop-tick.md's first step, once per
# supervisor tick. Invoked, not merely documented (the `acp_transport.py`/
# `worktree.sh`/`lane-done.sh` shape: a tool nothing calls is a documentation
# rule with a binary attached).
#
# The watchdog was originally REJECTED as the caller, in #99's own comments,
# on the grounds that "a broken watchdog would reinstall itself every 180s and
# nothing would be left to notice." #130 reversed that, and the reversal is
# the more interesting half: the objection is answered by THE GATE below, not
# by declining to deploy. A candidate that cannot run is never installed, so
# the copy left unable to notice anything never becomes live. Meanwhile the
# loop -- the caller the objection left in place -- is the component that goes
# down, and is down by design during an escalation, so the live worktree
# stopped advancing exactly during the incidents it needed to be current for.
# The loop's call is kept: it is the path that still works when the watchdog
# is running from somewhere other than the pinned worktree.
#
# Still rejected, unchanged:
#   - a merge webhook / CI step: puts the deploy decision in the same system
#     that produced the change, which is what makes "merged does not mean
#     running" a safety property here.
#   - a plain timer: a clock deciding when to deploy, with none of the gates
#     a caller can supply. A supervisor tick is gated on real activity
#     (dispatch, review, merge) and a watchdog tick has already finished its
#     duties before it calls this; a bare timer is neither.
#
# CALLED FROM watchdog.sh, THIS SCRIPT CHECKS OUT OVER ITSELF. The watchdog
# runs a COPY of this file from a temporary path for that reason; do not
# "simplify" that away. Everything below runs from the copy, and the smoke
# test runs the candidate's own watchdog.sh out of the scratch worktree, so
# no process is ever reading a file this checkout is replacing.
#
# THE GATE: CI green is a property of the merge commit, not proof this
# machine's copy runs. Before switching LIVE's pin, check out the candidate
# commit into a throwaway worktree and run ITS OWN watchdog.sh once, pointed
# at scratch state, and confirm it writes a well-formed status file. That
# exercises the real entry point without ever touching the live loop: the
# smoke run's SUPERVISOR_PANE targets a pane that cannot exist, so the
# candidate takes the pane_unreadable/no_session branch and returns before
# any tmux send-keys is possible, and its SUPERVISOR_LIVE names a path it is
# not running from, so the candidate's own advance step sees that it is not
# the live copy and does nothing. A smoke test that advanced the live
# worktree would be the gate performing the act it exists to gate.
#
# THE RACE: the LaunchAgent runs watchdog.sh from LIVE on a fixed cadence.
# Swapping LIVE's working tree mid-tick can hand that tick a half-rewritten
# file. There is no lock -- watchdog.sh is not touched here, and adding one
# would change code #100 already shipped. Instead this reads watchdog.status's
# own `checked:` timestamp (the same file the watchdog writes every tick) and
# only advances in the window right after a tick, never blind and never in
# the stretch just before the next one is due. Called from the watchdog's own
# exit path that window is satisfied by construction -- the timestamp being
# read was written seconds earlier by the caller -- and the check still earns
# its place: it is what makes the LOOP's call safe, and what catches a tick
# that overran its own cadence.
#
# TWO CALLERS, STILL NO LOCK (#136). Since #132 two uncoordinated callers can
# reach this at once -- loop-tick.md's step 0 and watchdog.sh's exit trap -- and
# the normal case is the watchdog running from the pinned copy exactly when a
# supervisor tick begins. #136 filed that as low severity on the reasoned claim
# that git's own `index.lock` bounds the worst case. That claim was then driven
# rather than argued: 200 concurrent double-invocations against a throwaway
# worktree, two processes released from a shared barrier, swept across start
# offsets. 400 invocations, five distinct outcomes, all of them benign --
# 377 advanced, 10 refused on the locked checkout, 8 found the tree already
# current, 3 + 2 refused on a transiently dirty read. Zero left an invalid or
# unrecoverable worktree; no `index.lock` was ever orphaned; every iteration
# ended at the target with at least one caller having advanced it.
#
# Two of those outcomes were not predicted by the issue and are worth knowing
# before debugging one: the dirty guards can fire on a tree that is not dirty.
# A concurrent `git checkout --detach` writes files before it moves HEAD, so the
# other invocation's `git status --porcelain` can catch a real file reported as
# untracked. The message says "became dirty while the smoke test ran" and the
# tree is clean by the time a human looks. That is a misleading diagnosis, not
# an unsafe one -- it still refuses, loudly, with LIVE untouched.
#
# So NO LOCK, deliberately. A lock would convert "one caller refuses and the
# other advances" into "one caller waits", and the caller most likely to wait is
# watchdog.sh's exit trap -- a watchdog blocked on a mutex is a watchdog not
# watching, which is the failure this whole tool exists downstream of. The
# current shape already has the property a lock would buy: the advance is never
# lost, because the caller that refuses is the redundant one.
# tests/supervisor/test_advance_live.sh holds `index.lock` to pin the refusal
# mechanism and races 20 real double-invocations to pin the invariants.
#
# ROLLBACK: the pre-advance sha is written to disk before anything is
# mutated, because it is only knowable then -- after `checkout --detach` you
# are guessing from reflog.
#
# FAILURE IS LOUD: a failed smoke test, an unreadable origin/main, or a
# checkout that lands somewhere other than the target all exit non-zero with
# the live worktree left exactly where it was. No silent revert, no
# half-state.

# --- agent-supervisor#24: the watchdog's own absence must be loud ----------
# `watchdog.status`'s `checked:` line is the watchdog's own heartbeat: it is
# rewritten on every tick, including every early-exit path (watchdog.sh's
# report()), so it going stale means the LaunchAgent itself stopped ticking,
# not that the loop is merely idle. On 2026-08-13 the watchdog was unloaded
# for 91 minutes (10:14:38Z-11:45:36Z) and nothing here noticed: it was found
# only because a human happened to `cat` this file and compare it to the
# clock by hand.
#
# THIS is where that check lives, not a new script, and not lanes.sh:
#   - advance-live.sh already runs on every supervisor tick -- it is
#     loop-tick.md's literal first step -- so wiring the check in here needs
#     nothing new remembered on the tick's path. A separate script the tick
#     has to additionally call is exactly the shape #81/#99 both criticised
#     ("a step in a brief is a step that can be skipped"; "a tool nothing
#     calls is a documentation rule with a binary attached").
#   - advance-live.sh already parses this exact file's `checked:` line, for
#     the unrelated post-tick race gate below (watchdog_age). Reusing that
#     function keeps one parser for one timestamp instead of two that could
#     drift.
#   - lanes.sh answers "what is tmux doing" from pane content; it has no
#     reason to open a state-directory status file, and teaching it to would
#     duplicate watchdog_age() for no caller this script does not already
#     have.
#
# WHY THIS RUNS BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE, not folded into the race gate lower
# down: the race gate is only reached when LIVE is genuinely behind
# origin/main (the `cur = target` shortcut returns first) -- so a dead
# watchdog with an up-to-date live copy would sail through this script
# reporting nothing wrong, the exact failure this check exists to close.
#
# WHY A MULTIPLE OF THE TICK INTERVAL, not the race gate's own
# TICK_INTERVAL-SAFETY_BUFFER window: that window is deliberately tight (it
# exists to stay OUT of a live tick), and tripping this alarm on ordinary
# scheduling jitter between two watchdog ticks would make it noise within a
# single healthy cadence -- exactly the false-alarm-every-tick shape #22
# named as how a real alarm gets ignored. Three tick intervals (9 minutes at
# the default 180s cadence) is short enough to catch a dead watchdog in a
# couple of ticks and long enough that a healthy watchdog, which rewrites
# this line every ~180s, never gets near it.
#
# Exits non-zero and never returns: a stale watchdog is reported LOUDLY, on
# this script's own exit code, rather than folded into `skip()`'s quiet
# exit-0 shape used for "outside the safe window, try again next tick" --
# those are both correct-and-boring; this is not -- UNLESS the classifier
# below attributes the staleness to a deliberate bootout, in which case it is
# reported and this returns 0.

# --- agent-supervisor#37 (review of #24): stopped is not dead ---------------
# #24's own review (PR #37) rejected the fix above as-is: `:216` said the
# LaunchAgent "may be unloaded or dead", collapsing two very different causes
# into one alarm. The Director deliberately stops this same LaunchAgent
# during incidents, so an alarm that cannot tell "I stopped it on purpose"
# from "it died" is an alarm a human learns to ignore -- which is the exact
# failure #24 itself was filed over (a real signal, ignored). This
# classifies staleness before it is reported, using the same evidence the
# reviewer confirmed was available for the #24 incident itself: launchd's own
# unified log, and whether the LaunchAgent is currently loaded.
#
# TWO INDEPENDENT SIGNALS, EITHER SUFFICIENT, because either one going
# unreadable must not silently downgrade a real death:
#   - the unified log carries launchd's own bootout record for this label --
#     the most direct evidence a human or `launchctl bootout` acted on it.
#   - `launchctl print` for the label currently failing is corroborating
#     evidence PROVIDED watchdog_age() already proved this label was ticking
#     before (a status file with a readable `checked:` line does not exist
#     unless something loaded and ran); a label that is both stale AND still
#     loaded is not explained by a bootout at all -- that shape is a hung or
#     crash-looping process, i.e. dead, not stopped.
#
# FAIL CLOSED ON "CANNOT TELL": if neither signal is readable (log command
# missing/erroring, launchctl unreadable) this echoes "unknown", which
# watchdog_stale_check treats identically to "dead" -- loud. An unreadable
# log downgrading a real death to a shrug is worse than a false alarm on a
# deliberate stop; #24 was filed over a signal nobody saw, not over one
# extra alert.
#
# Echoes exactly one of stopped|dead|loaded_not_firing|unknown and always
# returns 0 -- this is a classifier, not a gate; watchdog_stale_check decides
# what each means.

# --- agent-dotfiles#187: restart a stale inbox-poll.sh ----------------------
# inbox-poll.sh is the estate's OTHER long-running process pinned to LIVE --
# same defect #130/#132 fixed here for the watchdog itself, deployed later
# and left with no equivalent. This is the analogous fix, not a second
# mechanism: it runs from right here, where LIVE's post-advance head sha is
# already known, and compares it against the `sha:` line inbox-poll.sh
# writes into its own status file every iteration.
#
# COOPERATIVE, NOT SIGNALED (see inbox-poll.sh's matching header comment for
# the read side). This writes a flag file -- it never signals the process. A
# restart it triggers can therefore never land mid-drain: inbox-poll.sh only
# checks the flag between iterations, after a batch's offset has been both
# acknowledged to Telegram AND fully routed, so nothing is skipped and
# nothing is asked for twice.
#
# agent-supervisor#10: this used to ALSO queue a relaunch command into the
# poller's pane with `tmux send-keys`, reasoning that inbox-poll.sh never
# reads stdin, so the keystrokes would sit unread until "the shell resumes
# reading". There is no shell to resume: the pane's command is
# `exec scripts/supervisor/inbox-poll.sh`, which replaces the pane's shell
# rather than running under one, so when the flagged poller actually exits
# there is nothing left in the pane to read those keys -- and, absent
# `remain-on-exit`, no pane left at all. That queuing is gone. It is also no
# longer needed: poller-recover.sh notices the pane go dead once the flagged
# poller exits and relaunches it with whatever code is on disk at $LIVE. The
# watchdog still calls poller-recover.sh every tick as the backstop, but
# waiting for that cadence was agent-supervisor#47: every merge could leave
# inbound down until the next 180s sweep. The prompt path below starts a
# short background waiter from the process that wrote the flag, waits for the
# old pid to exit, then invokes the same poller-recover.sh mechanism
# immediately. poller-recover.sh keeps ownership of launch idempotency and
# duplicate-poller prevention; advance-live.sh only removes the cadence gap.
#
# THE PANE IS FOUND BY THE POLLER WINDOW, not by `pane_current_command` or the
# pane process argv. The live poller can read as a shell even when healthy, so
# process matching is not the poller identity. The shared helper is also used

# --- agent-supervisor#11: fetch before comparing ---------------------------
# Until this fix, `origin/main` below was whatever the worktree's LOCAL ref
# last happened to hold -- nothing on this path ever refreshed it, so a
# worktree that was genuinely behind compared clean against its own stale
# ref and printed NOTHING, twice, in production (issue #11: live sat still
# for up to 30 minutes holding a merged fix out of deployment, with neither
# an ADVANCED nor an ADVANCE-REFUSED line to show for it). A failed fetch
# must not fall through to that same silent "current" -- it is reported and
# refused exactly as loudly as any other fail() below, never folded into
# skip()'s quiet exit-0 shape. "could not tell" and "genuinely current" were
# the same silence before; they are not the same message now.
#
# agent-supervisor#51: bounded with a hard timeout, for the same reason --
# a hang here is not "current", it is a fourth thing (WEDGED) that must not
# read as any of the other three. Not a `timeout`/`gtimeout` wrapper: the
# watchdog pins PATH deliberately (SUPERVISOR_PATH, watchdog.sh) and this
# repo's own test suite runs advance-live.sh against a PATH of only
# /usr/bin:/bin to prove that pin holds -- neither ships GNU coreutils on
# macOS, so a script that *required* an external timeout binary would fail
# closed on every real production tick.
#
# Not `set -m` (bash job control) either: a process-group kill was the
# first version of this fix, and it was dropped after this exact test
# hung the suite intermittently under this harness -- `wait` on a job
# started under job control from inside a captured `$(...)` did not
# reliably see the child exit, a known class of bash/job-control/pipe
# interaction, not specific to this script. The poll loop below is
# strictly less elegant (a 1s-granularity `kill -0` loop, not an
# interrupt) and only reaches the `git` pid itself, not any transport
# helper it forks (ssh, git-remote-https) -- but it is deterministic,
# which a fetch bound cannot compromise on without becoming exactly the
# kind of intermittent hang it exists to prevent.
