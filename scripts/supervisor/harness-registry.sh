# The harness adapter registry: load every harness/*.sh into parallel arrays
# and answer "which adapter, if any, owns this pane?".
#
# SOURCE this file (`. harness-registry.sh`); it defines variables and
# functions and runs nothing else. It has no shebang-worthy behaviour of its
# own -- the shebang above is for shellcheck and for the executable-bit
# convention this directory's scripts share.
#
# agent-dotfiles#201 gave every harness its own file under harness/ and made
# `lanes.sh` ask the adapter instead of naming a harness itself. This file is
# #215 taking the second step: the LOADER moved out of lanes.sh so a second
# consumer -- watchdog.sh, whose busy probe was still one Claude Code literal
# with no fail-closed branch -- can ask the same adapters rather than growing
# a second, divergent copy of them. Nothing about the contract changed in the
# move; the block below is lanes.sh's, verbatim apart from the variable names
# for this file's own directory.
#
# Sets, all parallel and keyed by POSITION:
#   HARNESS_IDS  H_COMMAND_RE  H_READY_RE  H_BUSY_RE  H_BUSY_TAIL
#   H_BLOCKED_MARKERS  H_OPTION_ROW_RE  H_MENU_ENTER_RE  H_MENU_TAIL
#   H_TEXT_PROMPT_RE  H_LAUNCH_CMD  H_RESUME_CMD  H_SEND_LITERAL
# and defines harness_index_for_command / harness_index_for_name.
#
# agent-dotfiles#237 loads the two COMMAND fields into arrays for the first
# time. `HARNESS_LAUNCH_CMD` has been recorded in harness/claude.sh since #201
# with a comment saying no caller reads it; `restore.sh` is that caller, and
# `HARNESS_RESUME_CMD` (a printf format taking the session id) is its sibling.
# An empty H_RESUME_CMD is meaningful and is the default: it says this harness
# has no resume dialect here, and `restore.sh` reports such a lane
# unrecoverable rather than starting a fresh agent in it.
#
# #15 (agent-supervisor) is the first caller of `HARNESS_SEND_LITERAL`, so it
# is loaded into its own parallel array here for the first time -- until now
# every harness/*.sh set it and nothing read it back (see harness/claude.sh's
# and harness/codex.sh's own "not wired into either yet" notes). `dispatch.sh`
# needs it to know whether typing a harness's own launch command into a fresh
# shell requires `-l`, same dialect question `H_LAUNCH_CMD` already answers
# for what to type.
#
# Parallel INDEXED arrays, not `declare -A`. Every caller in this directory
# invokes its script by its own shebang, which runs it under `/bin/bash` --
# macOS's own, stuck at 3.2.57 (no associative arrays) even when a newer
# `bash` sits on PATH. Checked live, not assumed: `/bin/bash -c 'declare -A
# x'` on this machine fails with "invalid option". Indexed arrays and
# `${!arr[@]}` both predate bash 3.2, so this loader matches the feature set
# its callers already rely on rather than introducing the one construct that
# would make every real invocation fail closed at line 1.

# would abort the caller rather than return "nothing recognises this". The
