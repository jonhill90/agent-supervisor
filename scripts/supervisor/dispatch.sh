#!/bin/bash
# Dispatch one issue to one lane: pick a free lane, claim the issue, CREATE
# THE LANE'S WORKTREE, then send the brief. One command, or nothing happens.
#
# WHY: agent-dotfiles#81. `worktree.sh` was built for #73 and nothing called
# it -- `grep -rn worktree.sh` found three code fences in loop-tick.md and a
# section of the supervisor README, and that was all. The tool fails closed
# when it is called; what was missing was anything that calls it. Enforcement
# was "the dispatcher reads the file and runs the command", which is the same
# mechanism whose failure produced #73: a lane had its branch switched out
# from under it in the shared checkout and lost four files of uncommitted
# work. The risk moved from the lanes to the dispatcher; it did not go away.
#
# The estate has now hit this shape three times: acp_transport.py (302 lines,
# tested, zero importers, #56), claim.sh (wired into the dispatch step by #74,
# the one that got it right), and worktree.sh (#81). A tool that fails closed
# when called, and that nothing calls, is a documentation rule with a binary
# attached. So the sequence a dispatcher used to perform by hand -- read
# lanes.sh, run claim.sh, run worktree.sh, rename the window, send-keys --
# lives here, where the worktree step cannot be the one that gets skipped.
#
# REFINEMENT (agent-dotfiles#222): the rule above has an opposite failure
# mode, not just the nothing-calls-it one. An abstraction can be present and
# CORRECTLY avoided. When callers route around a seam because its
# implementation is worse than the ad-hoc code it would replace, that is
# indistinguishable from outside from the nothing-calls-it defect above --
# and is its opposite. Wiring the caller in "fixes" it by importing the
# defect. The test for an adapter is "is the implementation fit to be
# called?", not "is there a caller?". When the answer is no, the avoidance
# must be recorded at the seam, not only in whichever caller dodged it. Live
# instance: adapter.classify_capture's header comment, avoided by this very
# script's dispatch path -- see that comment for the mechanics.
#
# EVERY FAILURE ABORTS THE DISPATCH. In particular a failed `worktree.sh new`
# is fatal: a lane with no worktree works in the shared checkout, and that is
# the original bug, not a degraded mode of operation. Whatever was already
# done -- the claim, the worktree -- is undone before exiting, so a failed
# dispatch leaves the estate exactly as it found it and the issue stays
# available to the next tick.
#
# Usage:
#   dispatch.sh <issue>[,<issue>...] <slug> <brief-file> [repo] [repo-path] [--reviews-pr <PR>]
#
# <issue>      one issue number, or a comma-separated list (agent-dotfiles#112)
#              when one brief covers several -- e.g. `110,109`. Every issue in
#              the list is claimed; the lane still gets ONE worktree and ONE
#              brief, because it is doing one piece of work that happens to
#              close more than one issue.
# <slug>       short reason, e.g. `dispatch-worktree`; with <issue> it names
#              both the lane branch and the tmux window.
# <brief-file> the worker's complete brief. Sent by path, not pasted: a brief
#              large enough to be worth writing is too large for send-keys.
# [repo]       OWNER/NAME for the claim; omitted, gh resolves it from [repo-path].
# [repo-path]  the shared checkout to branch the worktree from; default $PWD.
# --reviews-pr <PR>
#              this dispatch is a review of PR <PR>. dispatch.sh (#212) then
#              refuses any candidate lane that authored that PR's branch,
#              fails closed if authorship cannot be determined at all, and
#              proceeds unchanged if the flag is omitted -- see step 0.5.
#
# Exit 0 only when a lane has been sent a brief. Exit 1 on any refusal --
# no free lane, an issue someone else already claimed, a worktree that could
# not be created, a send that failed, or a review whose only free lane wrote
# the PR under review.

# leaves its placeholder behind holding a lane that nothing is working. The

# immediately before selection means capacity comes back on the very next
# dispatch attempt instead of on some sweep's schedule.

# --- 0.5. a review must not land on the lane that wrote what it reviews ---

# 4, the same lane that had written the code under review (ad193/ad204),
# and its APPROVE had to be thrown away. This is that refusal, built the way
# #174 requires: BY LEDGER RECORD, never by window name -- for a lane the
# ledger already knows, `cli.py lane_free` answers from the ledger alone and
# the window name is never consulted (see step 1's own comment), so a name
# cannot be used to steer a review away from its author either.
#
# Only runs when the caller says this dispatch IS a review, via
# `--reviews-pr`. Ordinary (non-review) dispatches are unaffected -- there is
# no author to avoid.
#
# THE MAPPING THIS RELIES ON, verified against the code that writes both
# sides of it rather than assumed:
#   * `worktree.sh new "${ISSUE}-${SLUG}"` (step 3 below) creates branch
#     `lane/${ISSUE}-${SLUG}` -- literally `BRANCH="lane/$SLUG"` in
#     worktree.sh, where the caller's $SLUG here is already `$ISSUE-$SLUG`.
#   * Step 6 below records that same dispatch's task under id
#     `$WINDOW_NAME`, i.e. `${PREFIX}${ISSUE}-${SLUG}` -- and `tasks.id` is a
#     SQLite PRIMARY KEY; `Ledger._assign_tx` raises rather than let a second
#     lane reuse an existing task id (core.py), so a task id's `lane` column
#     never silently changes owner once written.
# So `lane/<n>-<slug>` on a PR's head branch and task id `${PREFIX}<n>-<slug>`
# are two spellings of the same fact, produced by the same dispatch, and the
# second is a permanent ledger row. Neither spelling includes REPO's OWNER,
# so this check only makes sense within one repo -- exactly what a single
# `dispatch.sh` invocation already is.
#
# FAILS CLOSED throughout: `gh` unreachable, a PR with no head branch, a head
# branch outside the `lane/<n>-<slug>` convention (hand-pushed, or from
# before #81 wired worktrees into every dispatch), or a task id the ledger
# has no row for -- every one of these means authorship cannot be
# determined, and this refuses the WHOLE dispatch rather than guess. A
# candidate lane is only ever excluded, never assumed innocent from missing

# --- 1. a lane that is actually safe to dispatch to ------------------------
# `send-keys -t session:` with an empty index does not error; it targets the
# active window, which is usually the supervisor. Refuse an empty target
# rather than discover where the brief landed.
#
# TWO questions, and `lanes.sh --free` only answers the first. "Is an agent
# there and not mid-turn" it answers from pane content -- that stays exactly
# as it was; lanes.sh keeps classifying panes, this change is not about that.
# "Is this lane UNOWNED" is the ledger's question now, not the window name's:
# a lane that finished and was never renamed, and a lane paused on an
# approval prompt, both show no busy marker and are byte-identical to a
# genuinely idle one from pane content alone, and the ledger is what breaks
# that tie. On 2026-08-11 the supervisor took `--free | head -1` by hand, got
# another dispatcher's task-named lane, and `/clear`ed it; nothing was lost
# only because that lane had already shipped.
#
# The window NAME still matters for exactly one thing: MIGRATION. A lane the
# ledger has never heard of -- every lane alive before this landed, or one
# opened by hand -- is backfilled into the ledger as free the FIRST time it
# is seen named `free-N`, and never consulted by name again after that (see
# `cli.py lane_free`'s docstring). A lane the ledger already knows about, free
# or occupied, answers from the ledger alone regardless of what it is
# currently named -- that is the inversion #174 exists to prove: an occupied
# lane hand-renamed to `free-N` is still not offered.
#
# There is deliberately NO env-var override of this selection. `DISPATCH_LANE`
# used to be honoured verbatim -- no free check, no name check, no supervisor
# exclusion -- and `DISPATCH_LANE=t:1` put `/clear` plus a full brief into the
# supervisor's own pane at exit 0, which is the incident loop-tick.md records
# under "an empty tmux target hits the ACTIVE window", reached through a stray
# environment variable instead of an empty string. Nothing called it. An
# escape hatch around the only guard is not worth a caller it does not have.
#
# agent-dotfiles#184 (closing #188 finding 2's own gap): `lane-free` is a
# QUERY, not a claim -- see `cli.py lane_free`'s own docstring for the
# measured proof. Left alone, nothing re-checks between a candidate reading
# free and the first `send-keys` several steps below, and that window is not
# sub-second the way `claim.sh`'s is: it spans claim, worktree creation and
# the send itself. So a candidate reading free is now followed IMMEDIATELY
# by `claim-lane`, an atomic write-then-verify (see `Ledger.claim_lane`'s
# docstring): it inserts a placeholder occupying the lane, protected by the
# same `one_open_task_per_lane` unique index the rest of the ledger already
# relies on, and re-reads to confirm the placeholder it just wrote is still
# the one occupying the lane. Two dispatchers racing the SAME candidate are
# serialized by that call, not by this loop -- the loser's claim is refused,
# not merged, and it moves on to the next candidate instead of stopping.
# `record_dispatch` (step 6) still mints a fresh nonce and cancels whatever
# was outstanding for the lane on every call (measured, #183 round 3) -- but
# by the time it runs, "whatever was outstanding" is this dispatch's OWN
# claim, not a stranger's, because the claim already closed the window a
# stranger could have used.
CLAIM_TOKEN="$WINDOW_NAME"
# agent-dotfiles#209. Two guards, and they are not the same guard.
#
# CLAIM_LANE: nothing has been claimed yet, so there is nothing to release.
#
# CLAIM_COMMITTED: step 4.5 has marked the claim LIVE and the brief is going
# into a real pane, so this dispatch is no longer unwindable. Past that point
# releasing the claim would free a lane that is actively working --
# #102/#126's failure, caused by the cleanup rather than prevented by it. It
# matters because of the trap below, which fires on the SUCCESS path too: on a
# clean dispatch `record_dispatch`'s own `_register_lane_tx` has already
# cancelled this placeholder, so the release would be a harmless no-op -- but
# when `record_dispatch` FAILS (non-fatal by design, step 6) the placeholder is
# still the only thing holding the lane, and deleting it would hand a working
# lane to the next dispatcher.
#
# THIS FLAG IS A FAST PATH, NOT THE GUARANTEE (agent-dotfiles#209 round 2).
# Round 1 had only this flag, set ~70 lines after the brief was submitted, and
# a signal landing in between freed a working lane. The durable half is now
# step 4.5's `commit-lane-claim`, which moves the row to a status
# `release-lane-claim` is scoped away from -- so even a signal arriving
# between that ledger write and the assignment of this variable is safe, and
# so is a SIGKILL that never lets this shell run anything again.

# dispatch.sh had none. Its four inline `release_lane_claim` calls cover the
# four failures it ENUMERATES; a `kill`, a timeout wrapper, a closed terminal
# or a crashed shell are not among them and left the claim behind.
#
# EXIT alone is not enough, for the reason #187 measured on inbox-poll.sh: an

# AFTER the brief goes live leaves a claim the reap deliberately will not

# at an automatic cleanup -- because the alternative is handing the next
# dispatcher a lane with a worker in it, and that is the loss this whole

#
# Measured against a real Claude Code TUI at 80x24 (throwaway tmux server, one
# probe per length, never a live lane):
#
#   ~450 chars -> head visible          ~500 chars -> HEAD LOST

# The first version of the deliverable contract lived in this string and took

# passed 3/3 at 126x60 -- and `free-9` and `free-10` are 80x24, so it broke
# dispatch to real lanes while every stub test stayed green (#118 review).
#
# So the contract is NOT in this string. The message is back to 389 characters
# with representative paths, and `MESSAGE_BUDGET` below pins that this stays
# true: the paths are the bulk of it and they vary, so the margin is thin and
# it is enforced rather than remembered.
#

# over-budget message means this dispatch is refused regardless of anything
# below, and there is no reason to kill and relaunch a lane's harness only to
# then abort without ever typing into it.

# --- 3.5. put the lane IN its worktree, at the OS level (#15) --------------
#
# Measured on a live codex lane (#15): `lsof -a -p "$(tmux list-panes ... pane_pid)" -d cwd`
# resolved to the SHARED checkout, never the worktree just created above,
# even though the brief typed into the pane a few lines below names the
# worktree and tells the lane to work only there. The harness process
# occupying the pane had its cwd fixed the moment it was execed -- at lane
# creation (`bootstrap-session.sh`'s `new-window -c "$WORKDIR"`) or its last
# relaunch -- and nothing after that point can change a running process's
# cwd from outside it. Typing `cd $WORKTREE` into the pane does not touch
# that cwd: past this point in a lane's life the pane is not a shell, it is
# the harness's own chat input box, and text sent there is a PROMPT, read and
# acted on by the agent, never executed by a shell. A Claude lane usually
# gets away with it because it reasons in absolute paths; a codex lane does
# not, which is exactly how #15 was caught.
#
# So the fix is not a stronger sentence in the brief (#15 already had one,
# and it still failed -- the shape #73/#81/#263 keep closing). It is the same
# mechanism `restore.sh` already uses to put a restored lane in the right
# directory: `-c <dir>` on the tmux call that creates the pane's process,
# which sets the REAL, OS-level starting directory before anything runs in
# it. `restore.sh` gets that for free because it always creates a fresh
# window. `dispatch.sh` reuses an existing lane's window, so the equivalent
# here is `respawn-pane -k -c "$WORKTREE"`: kill whatever the harness left
# running (the pool only ever offers this step a FREE lane -- ledger and
# lanes.sh both said so above -- so there is no live conversation to lose,
# same as `restore.sh`'s own "no open task -> restore fresh" branch) and
# start a brand-new shell whose cwd is the worktree. The harness is then
# relaunched INTO that shell with its adapter's own `HARNESS_LAUNCH_CMD` --
# a real shell command, typed into a real shell prompt, which is the one
# place in this script's lifetime a `cd`-shaped instruction is actually
# obeyed by something other than the agent choosing to obey it.
#
# Fails closed: a harness this dispatch cannot identify, or one whose

# an unverifiable cwd -- the exact failure mode #15 is about, produced on

# fit in it; the brief file has no such limit and is the thing the lane is told

## Delivering this work

Added by \`dispatch.sh\` on every dispatch, not by the brief's author.

Unless this brief says otherwise, when you are finished:
**push your branch and open a PR**.
If you produced no code -- a review, an investigation, an options paper --
**post your findings as a comment** on the issue or PR the brief names.

Do not stop with the work only in your worktree. From outside, a lane that
finished without shipping is indistinguishable from a lane that did nothing:
unshipped work looks exactly like no work, and the worktree is temporary.

# agent-dotfiles#209 round 2. `CLAIM_COMMITTED` used to be set ~70 lines below
# this, after step 5's confirmation loop -- and step 5 costs up to
# DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE (10s by default) of wall clock. So
# for that whole window the lane was renamed and the brief was ABOUT to be
# live, while both cleanup paths still believed the dispatch was unwindable. A
# SIGTERM landing there ran the trap and deleted the claim, and
# `lane_available` answered True for a lane that was actively working -- #102's
# shape produced BY the cleanup, which step 6's own comment below says in its
# own words must not happen. Reproduced against the stubs, both directions, in
# tests/supervisor/test_dispatch.sh.
#
# So the commit happens HERE, before the Enter rather than after the
# confirmation, because "the brief is live" starts at the submit and not at
# the moment the bookkeeping finishes noticing.
#
# IT IS WRITTEN TO THE LEDGER, not just to this shell. `CLAIM_COMMITTED` below
# is only a fast path for the trap; it dies with this process, and the SIGKILL
# case is exactly the one where this process stops existing while the pane
# keeps working. `commit-lane-claim` moves the placeholder to a status both
# `release_lane_claim` and `reap-lane-claims` refuse to touch, so the
# protection survives a kill that no shell can trap. That ordering also means
# a signal arriving BETWEEN the ledger write and the assignment below is
# already safe: the trap's release matches no row.
#
# WHAT THE REORDERING COSTS, stated rather than discovered later. From here
# every failure leaves the lane HELD -- including a send that fails outright,
# and step 5 concluding the brief never left the input box. Those used to free
# the lane. That is deliberate and it is the fail-closed direction: a lane
# wrongly held costs capacity and is recovered by the documented command the
# "no free lane" refusal prints; a lane wrongly freed costs a running lane's
# work and is recovered by nothing. `lanes.sh` still shows such a lane
# `unsent`, so the cost is visible rather than silent.
#
# FATAL IF IT FAILS, and that is the same argument pointing the other way:
# nothing has gone into the pane yet, so refusing is still free, and sending a
# brief we could not first mark as live would leave the exact window this
# block exists to close.

# default) to a slow-confirming one. That is the price of #141: it is what
# turns "the dispatcher printed success" into "the box actually went empty",
# so do not tune DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES down to make dispatch feel faster

# The dispatch was committed at step 4.5, not here. This comment used to
# introduce a `CLAIM_COMMITTED=1` on this line, and that placement was
# agent-dotfiles#209's blocking defect: everything it says about a brief being
# live in a real pane was already true ~70 lines and up to
# DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE earlier, at the `send-keys Enter`
# above. The reasoning was right and the position was wrong, so the position
# moved; do not move it back. What that reasoning still buys, unchanged, is
# the case below: a `record_dispatch` FAILURE is non-fatal by design and falls
# straight through to the exit, where the EXIT trap runs -- and the claim
# placeholder is then the only thing keeping a working lane out of the next
# dispatcher's hands. Step 4.5's ledger commit is what makes both the trap and
# the reap leave it alone.

# --- 6. record what was dispatched. BEST EFFORT, NEVER FATAL --------------
#
# agent-dotfiles#140, updated by agent-dotfiles#174. Every signal that a lane
# is busy used to be inferred from pane content, and inference is what
# produced the false-`free` bugs #102, #123 and #126. This writes the fact
# down instead.
#
# #140 made this write non-fatal because NOTHING READ IT YET -- a recording
# layer nothing depends on can be wrong without taking the estate down. That
# premise is gone: step 1 above now reads exactly this record to pick every
# future lane, and #174 was filed to make that inversion explicit rather than
# leave this comment asserting the opposite of what the code now does. Read
# what follows as "still non-fatal, for a DIFFERENT reason", not as the old
# reason left unexamined.
#
# THIS BLOCK STILL MUST NOT ABORT THE DISPATCH, AND THAT IS STILL THE
# OPPOSITE OF EVERY OTHER STEP ABOVE. The brief has already been typed,
# verified and submitted into a REAL, LIVE pane by the time this block runs --
# unwinding the claim and the worktree here would strand a worker that is
# actively working, which is strictly worse than a stale ledger row. So the
# failure mode this block accepts is not "the estate may dispatch to a lane
# that is actually busy" -- it is "this ONE lane stops being offered until
# reconciliation happens". That cost is bounded and visible (the LOUD message
# below, and `lanes.sh` still showing the window doing nothing); trading the
# live worker for it would not be. Do not "fix" it into an abort_send;
# tests/supervisor/test_dispatch.sh mutation-checks that removing this
# tolerance turns the suite red.
#
# agent-dotfiles#188 finding 1: step 1's fail-closed read does NOT rule out
# "actually busy" on its own here. `Ledger.record_dispatch` is one
# transaction, so a failure rolls back every one of its five writes -- and
# for a lane the ledger already had registered free (every lane after its
# first backfill, and every lane `lane-done.sh` has ever freed, which is
# ordinary steady state, not an edge case), rollback restores exactly that
# pre-existing FREE row, not UNKNOWN. A comment here used to claim the
# unrecorded lane reads UNKNOWN regardless; it does not, and #188 is the
# defect that shape produces (also #145, #170: a comment asserting a
# protection the code does not have). `cli.py`'s `record_dispatch` now closes
# that window itself -- on any failure it calls `Ledger.mark_lane_held`
# before re-raising, which writes a placeholder outstanding task for the
# lane so `lane_available` reads occupied, not whatever it read before the
# call. That write happens inside the Python process handling this exact
# failure, so it is not conditional on this bash block at all; what follows
# here is only the loud, human-facing report of what already happened.
#
# WHY IT RUNS LAST, after the final Enter and past every abort path: a record
# asserting work is in flight, left behind by a dispatch that then aborted, is
# worse than no record at all -- the point of the ledger is to be believed.
# Ordering is what guarantees that, not cleanup, so nothing above this line
# needs an unwind for it.
#
# That is also why step 5 (#141) sits ABOVE this block rather than below it.
# Step 5 can abort_send -- a brief that was typed but never submitted unwinds
# the claim and the worktree -- and a ledger record written before it would be
# exactly the "work is in flight" claim this paragraph rules out, asserted
# about a lane that is running nothing.
