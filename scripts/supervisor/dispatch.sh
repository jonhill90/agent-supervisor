# Dispatch one issue to one lane: pick a free lane, claim the issue, CREATE
# THE LANE'S WORKTREE, then send the brief. One command, or nothing happens.
#
# WHY: agent-dotfiles#81. `worktree.sh` was built for #73 and nothing called
# it -- `grep -rn worktree.sh` found three code fences in loop-tick.md and a
# section of the supervisor README, and that was all. The tool fails closed
# when it is called; what was missing was anything that calls it. Enforcement
# was "the dispatcher reads the file and runs the command", which is the same
# mechanism whose failure produced #73: a lane had its branch switched out
# from under it in the shared checkout and lost four files of uncommitted
# work. The risk moved from the lanes to the dispatcher; it did not go away.
#
# The estate has now hit this shape three times: acp_transport.py (302 lines,
# tested, zero importers, #56), claim.sh (wired into the dispatch step by #74,
# the one that got it right), and worktree.sh (#81). A tool that fails closed
# when called, and that nothing calls, is a documentation rule with a binary
# attached. So the sequence a dispatcher used to perform by hand -- read
# lanes.sh, run claim.sh, run worktree.sh, rename the window, send-keys --
# lives here, where the worktree step cannot be the one that gets skipped.
#
# REFINEMENT (agent-dotfiles#222): the rule above has an opposite failure
# mode, not just the nothing-calls-it one. An abstraction can be present and
# CORRECTLY avoided. When callers route around a seam because its
# implementation is worse than the ad-hoc code it would replace, that is
# indistinguishable from outside from the nothing-calls-it defect above --
# and is its opposite. Wiring the caller in "fixes" it by importing the
# defect. The test for an adapter is "is the implementation fit to be
# called?", not "is there a caller?". When the answer is no, the avoidance
# must be recorded at the seam, not only in whichever caller dodged it. Live
# instance: adapter.classify_capture's header comment, avoided by this very
# script's dispatch path -- see that comment for the mechanics.
#
# EVERY FAILURE ABORTS THE DISPATCH. In particular a failed `worktree.sh new`
# is fatal: a lane with no worktree works in the shared checkout, and that is
# the original bug, not a degraded mode of operation. Whatever was already
# done -- the claim, the worktree -- is undone before exiting, so a failed
# dispatch leaves the estate exactly as it found it and the issue stays
# available to the next tick.
#
# Usage:
#   dispatch.sh <issue>[,<issue>...] <slug> <brief-file> [repo] [repo-path] [--reviews-pr <PR>] [--not-a-review] [--pr <PR>]
#
# <issue>      one issue number, or a comma-separated list (agent-dotfiles#112)
#              when one brief covers several -- e.g. `110,109`. Every issue in
#              the list is claimed; the lane still gets ONE worktree and ONE
#              brief, because it is doing one piece of work that happens to
#              close more than one issue.
# <slug>       short reason, e.g. `dispatch-worktree`; with <issue> it names
#              both the lane branch and the tmux window.
# <brief-file> the worker's complete brief. Sent by path, not pasted: a brief
#              large enough to be worth writing is too large for send-keys.
# [repo]       OWNER/NAME for the claim; omitted, gh resolves it from [repo-path].
# [repo-path]  the shared checkout to branch the worktree from; default $PWD.
#              [repo] given with [repo-path] omitted is refused (#17): almost
#              always the mistake is believing [repo] alone also selects the
#              checkout. Set DISPATCH_ALLOW_CWD_REPO_PATH=1 to use $PWD anyway.
#              After the worktree is built, its `origin` is compared against
#              [repo] and the dispatch is refused on mismatch (#17).
# --reviews-pr <PR>
#              this dispatch is a review of PR <PR>. dispatch.sh (#212, widened
#              by #190) then refuses any candidate lane that CONTRIBUTED to
#              that PR -- its authoring dispatch, and any later dispatch
#              (e.g. a fix pass) recorded against the same issue or the same
#              worktree -- fails closed if that contributor set cannot be
#              determined at all, and proceeds unchanged if the flag is
#              omitted -- see step 0.5.
#              agent-supervisor#70: when omitted, dispatch.sh tries to infer
#              it from the issue's title, then the brief -- a line naming
#              both "review" and "PR #<N>" -- so a forgotten flag is not
#              automatically a silent self-review. Passing the flag
#              explicitly always wins and is never second-guessed.
# --not-a-review
#              this dispatch is NOT a review, whatever its brief says.
#              agent-supervisor#101: the inference above reads prose, and
#              prose about a PR is not the same as a review OF that PR --
#              "rebase it so it can be reviewed" plus "PR #93" was enough to
#              infer a review and refuse a rebase on authorship grounds. This
#              is the escape, taken at the DISPATCH rather than by rewording
#              the brief: it turns the inference off for this one invocation
#              and changes nothing else. The guard itself is untouched --
#              `--reviews-pr` still guards, prose still infers when neither
#              flag is given. Passing both flags is refused rather than
#              resolved: the two say opposite things about the same dispatch
#              and guessing which one is meant is exactly the guessing this
#              guard exists to avoid.
# --pr <PR>
#              agent-supervisor#159: this dispatch's real scope is PR <PR>,
#              not the issue(s) named by <issue> -- a review of PR <PR>, a
#              fix pass on it after REQUEST CHANGES, or any other follow-up
#              work on it. Two things follow: step 2 does NOT call
#              `claim.sh take` on <issue> at all (the issue stays claimed by
#              whatever opened <PR> -- that is the whole point, see #159's
#              own "why it matters"), and this dispatch is recorded in the
#              ledger keyed by the PR (`source_kind='pull'`), not the issue,
#              so a second dispatcher can see the PR is already spoken for
#              (`cli.py pr-lane`) instead of minting a second task for it.
#              `<issue>` is still required and still names the worktree and
#              tmux window -- it is where this dispatch's WORK happens to
#              live, not what it claims.
#              `--reviews-pr <PR>` IMPLIES `--pr <PR>` (a review is one kind
#              of PR-scoped dispatch, the one that also runs the author
#              guard above) -- passing both is fine as long as they name the
#              SAME PR; naming two different PRs is refused, the same
#              "neither is an inference this script may resolve" posture
#              `--reviews-pr`/`--not-a-review` already takes.
# --live-pane
#              (DISPATCH_LIVE_PANE=1 in the environment is the same thing
#              for every call this process makes, not just one -- see that
#              variable's own comment where LIVE_PANE is initialized.)
#              agent-supervisor#171: keep this dispatch on tmux/`send-keys`,
#              the pane the candidate lane already is, even when the winning
#              candidate's harness is `claude`. Default (this flag omitted):
#              when step 1 below picks a FREE `claude` lane and this is a
#              plain, single-issue, non-PR-scoped dispatch, dispatch.sh
#              releases that candidate untouched and instead mints a brand
#              NEW `claude-print` lane for #<issue> (same mechanism
#              `dispatch-claude-print.sh` proved out for #171/#215) -- no
#              tmux pane, no send-keys, nothing left in an input box to
#              strand. `--live-pane` is the explicit opt-out for the roles
#              that genuinely need the candidate's persistent, watchable
#              pane: one that must be INTERRUPTED mid-turn, one that must
#              answer an INTERACTIVE PROMPT (a usage-limit dialog, a
#              permission request, a menu), or one WATCHED AND RESUMED BY A
#              HUMAN directly (`cli.py`'s own `adapter_for_harness` comment).
#              Measured against this script's own job (#255): an ordinary
#              `dispatch.sh <issue>` call is never any of the three -- it
#              claims an issue, hands a lane a brief, and collects a PR, the
#              same "dispatch-and-collect" shape as a review or a fix pass --
#              so there is no lane PROPERTY this script can read back out of
#              a pane to infer the three roles above; only the human
#              dispatching knows a given call is one of them, which is why
#              this is a caller decision, not something lanes.sh classifies.
#              A review (`--reviews-pr`), a PR-scoped follow-up (`--pr`) or a
#              multi-issue dispatch (`<issue>,<issue>...`) is left on the
#              pre-#171 tmux flow regardless of this flag for now --
#              `dispatch-claude-print.sh` does not yet speak any of those
#              three shapes, and silently dropping one would be worse than
#              routing it the old way; see agent-supervisor#171's own
#              tracked follow-up.
#
# Exit 0 only when a lane has been sent a brief -- over tmux/send-keys, or
# (new, #171, default for a plain single-issue `claude` dispatch) over a
# freshly minted `claude-print` lane. Exit 1 on any refusal -- no free lane,
# an issue someone else already claimed, a worktree that could not be
# created, a send that failed, a `claude-print` register/assign that could
# not reach `claude` (this NEVER falls back to send-keys -- see
# `dispatch-claude-print.sh`'s own header), or a review whose only free lane
# wrote the PR under review.

# That is the shape every review issue and brief in this estate's own
# history already uses (see the #212/#35 fixtures in
# tests/supervisor/test_dispatch.sh and loop-tick.md's own dispatch
# instructions). No new convention is introduced; this only reads ones that
# already exist.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT MATCHED: a bare "#<N>" with no "PR" word and no
# owner/repo before it. This estate's issues and briefs constantly say
# "closing issue #70" or "Fixes #240" right next to a PR reference on the
# same line ("review PR #500, no flag passed" is itself a title fixture
# below) -- a bare number would as often grab the issue being closed as the
# PR being reviewed, and inferring the WRONG PR is worse than inferring
# none (step 0.5's guard would refuse or exclude based on the wrong
# author). Likewise, `owner/repo#<N>` with no "PR" word is not matched: that
# exact shape is this repo's own convention for citing an ISSUE inline
# ("Fixes #240" close cousin), so matching it bare would conflate issue and
# PR references. The "PR " prefix is what disambiguates both.
#
# WRONG IN EACH DIRECTION, both survivable:
#   * FALSE POSITIVE (detected as a review when the dispatch is not one): the
#     worst outcome is step 0.5 below excluding one candidate lane it did not
#     need to, or refusing outright with "no free lane other than the
#     author" when that candidate was the only free one. Annoying, not
#     dangerous -- the message names exactly why, and the fix is to
#     re-dispatch (the issue's claim is released on refusal, same as every
#     other refusal path in this script).
#   * FALSE NEGATIVE (a real review not detected -- title and brief phrase it
#     differently than the shapes above): behaviour is exactly today's
#     status quo. The explicit flag remains the only guaranteed way to
#     trigger the guard; this block only catches the forgotten-flag case
#     when the issue happens to name the PR in one of the shapes above.
#
# agent-supervisor#101 changed NONE of the detection above. The false
# positive it reports is real -- "rebase it so it can be reviewed" next to
# "PR #93" is a rebase, not a review -- but every narrowing available reads
# the same prose the current pattern reads and so would drop real reviews
# this catches today, which is the dangerous direction. The escape is
# `--not-a-review` instead: an operator says "not a review" at the dispatch,
# where the intent actually lives, rather than rewording a brief until the
# tool stops matching it. Detection stays exactly as wide as it was; only the
# cost of being wrong changed, from "reword the brief" to "pass a flag".

# --- 0.5. a review must not land on the lane that wrote what it reviews ---
# agent-dotfiles#212. On 2026-08-12 a review of #204 was dispatched to lane
# 4, the same lane that had written the code under review (ad193/ad204),
# and its APPROVE had to be thrown away. This is that refusal, built the way
# #174 requires: BY LEDGER RECORD, never by window name -- for a lane the
# ledger already knows, `cli.py lane_free` answers from the ledger alone and
# the window name is never consulted (see step 1's own comment), so a name
# cannot be used to steer a review away from its author either.
#
# Only runs when the caller says this dispatch IS a review, via
# `--reviews-pr`. Ordinary (non-review) dispatches are unaffected -- there is
# no author to avoid.
#
# THE PRIMARY MAPPING (issue -> author lane) is `source_tasks.source_ref` (the
# issue number `record_dispatch` wrote it as, step 6 below) joined to
# `tasks.lane` by task id, with review tasks explicitly filtered out -- see
# `Ledger.get_author_task_for_issue`. Neither side comes from a branch name.
#
# THE FALLBACK MAPPING, used only when that lookup is silent, is #117's own
# fix: the WORKTREE `worktree.sh new` built for a dispatch (step 3 below) is
# recorded against that dispatch's task id at dispatch time (`--worktree`,
# step 6), and never touched again. That worktree is not renamed even when
# its branch is -- a lane routinely renames its checkout to a type-prefixed
# branch (`fix/`, `feat/`, ...) with a slug of its OWN choosing, unrelated
# to the dispatch slug the task id was minted from, so the branch on a PR is
# frequently NOT `<prefix>/<n>-<slug>` for the `$PREFIX`/`$SLUG` this
# dispatch would reconstruct (agent-supervisor#117: task
# `as101-reviewspr-inference` produced branch `fix/101-not-a-review-escape`
# -- the two slugs share no text at all). So this asks `git worktree list`
# which worktree currently has the PR's HEAD_REF checked out, then asks the
# ledger which task that worktree's PATH was recorded against -- a fact
# nobody has to reconstruct, because it was written once and never changes.
#
# A LEGACY fallback (step 3.1) still reconstructs a task id from the branch
# name, kept only for tasks dispatched before this column existed (they
# recorded no worktree path at all, so step 3 can never match them) -- see
# its own comment below for why it is trusted no further than before.
#
# FAILS CLOSED throughout: `gh` unreachable, a PR with no head branch, or
# every source below coming up silent -- every one of these means authorship
# cannot be determined, and this refuses the WHOLE dispatch rather than
# guess. A candidate lane is only ever excluded, never assumed innocent from
# missing data.
#
# agent-supervisor#35: a branch name is a label someone typed at dispatch
# time, not a record this system wrote -- the ledger row is. THE LEDGER IS
# ASKED FIRST NOW, keyed by the issue the PR closes, and the branch name is
# only ever consulted through a ledger record it points at, never trusted on
# its own -- first the worktree that produced it (#117), then, only for
# rows that predate that, the task id it implies by convention (#35).
# Measured on this repo's own merged history when #35 shipped: 3 of 11
# merged PRs, plus open PR #33, were unreviewable through the branch-only
# path -- see the #35 issue body for the count.
# agent-supervisor#190: this used to resolve a SINGLE `AUTHOR_LANE` -- the
# one task the ledger could name as having produced the PR's branch. Two
# live dispatches (this issue's own evidence) show why that is not enough:
# a FIX-PASS task dispatched against the same issue to address review
# findings (`as178-fix186`, fixing PR #186) is a second, later contributor
# to the same PR, sitting in the exact same `source_tasks` rows the single
# lookup below queries -- it was just discarded by the "narrow to one"
# step, and the lane that wrote it went on to approve its own fix.
#
# So this now builds a SET, `AUTHOR_LANES` (with `AUTHOR_TASKS` as its
# parallel "why" for messages) -- every lane the ledger can show contributed
# to this PR, not just the one it can name as "the" author. Plain indexed
# arrays, not `declare -A` (bash 3.2 has none -- see #199's own removal
# above), so membership is a linear scan (`author_lane_known`, below) and
# both are guarded with the same `"${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}"` bash-3.2-empty-

# pass, both times through the SAME task id with a "b" suffix -- something
# minted a second task for work that already had one instead of detecting
# the first. The shared cause: a ledger-bypassing tmux hand-off (the
# workaround for the issue-claim refusal this PR removes) leaves no row a
# second dispatcher can see. This is the detection that was missing --
# checked BEFORE step 1 picks a lane, so it costs nothing when it refuses:
# no lane claim taken yet, no worktree built.
#
# Only runs for a PR-scoped dispatch (`PR_SCOPED` set, see the flag block
# above) -- an ordinary issue-scoped dispatch has no PR to check yet, and
# `claim.sh` in step 2 below is exactly this same guarantee for that case,
# already proven. `cli.py pr-lane` asks `Ledger.get_open_task_for_pr`, which

# review of this PR must not block a fresh one.
#
# agent-supervisor#169: THIS CHECK ALONE IS A TOCTOU, and is not the whole

# (`record-dispatch --pr`, step 6, far below) does not happen until after
# lane selection, worktree creation and the brief itself -- a real,
# multi-second window, not the sub-second gap `claim.sh`'s own docstring
# accepts for the GitHub-assignee race. Two dispatchers can both pass this
# exact check before either one has recorded anything. What actually closes
# the race is `core.py`'s `one_open_pull_per_source_ref` trigger on
# `record-dispatch`'s write, at the bottom of this script -- this check
# stays because it is the FRIENDLY, EARLY refusal for the common case (no
# wasted worktree, no stray brief); it is not, by itself, load-bearing for

# --- 1. a lane that is actually safe to dispatch to ------------------------
# `send-keys -t session:` with an empty index does not error; it targets the
# active window, which is usually the supervisor. Refuse an empty target
# rather than discover where the brief landed.
#
# TWO questions, and `lanes.sh --free` only answers the first. "Is an agent
# there and not mid-turn" it answers from pane content -- that stays exactly
# as it was; lanes.sh keeps classifying panes, this change is not about that.
# "Is this lane UNOWNED" is the ledger's question now, not the window name's:
# a lane that finished and was never renamed, and a lane paused on an
# approval prompt, both show no busy marker and are byte-identical to a
# genuinely idle one from pane content alone, and the ledger is what breaks
# that tie. On 2026-08-11 the supervisor took `--free | head -1` by hand, got
# another dispatcher's task-named lane, and `/clear`ed it; nothing was lost
# only because that lane had already shipped.
#
# The window NAME still matters for exactly one thing: MIGRATION. A lane the
# ledger has never heard of -- every lane alive before this landed, or one
# opened by hand -- is backfilled into the ledger as free the FIRST time it
# is seen named `free-N`, and never consulted by name again after that (see
# `cli.py lane_free`'s docstring). A lane the ledger already knows about, free
# or occupied, answers from the ledger alone regardless of what it is
# currently named -- that is the inversion #174 exists to prove: an occupied
# lane hand-renamed to `free-N` is still not offered.
#
# There is deliberately NO env-var override of this selection. `DISPATCH_LANE`
# used to be honoured verbatim -- no free check, no name check, no supervisor
# exclusion -- and `DISPATCH_LANE=t:1` put `/clear` plus a full brief into the
# supervisor's own pane at exit 0, which is the incident loop-tick.md records
# under "an empty tmux target hits the ACTIVE window", reached through a stray
# environment variable instead of an empty string. Nothing called it. An
# escape hatch around the only guard is not worth a caller it does not have.
#
# agent-dotfiles#184 (closing #188 finding 2's own gap): `lane-free` is a
# QUERY, not a claim -- see `cli.py lane_free`'s own docstring for the
# measured proof. Left alone, nothing re-checks between a candidate reading
# free and the first `send-keys` several steps below, and that window is not
# sub-second the way `claim.sh`'s is: it spans claim, worktree creation and
# the send itself. So a candidate reading free is now followed IMMEDIATELY
# by `claim-lane`, an atomic write-then-verify (see `Ledger.claim_lane`'s
# docstring): it inserts a placeholder occupying the lane, protected by the
# same `one_open_task_per_lane` unique index the rest of the ledger already
# relies on, and re-reads to confirm the placeholder it just wrote is still
# the one occupying the lane. Two dispatchers racing the SAME candidate are
# serialized by that call, not by this loop -- the loser's claim is refused,
# not merged, and it moves on to the next candidate instead of stopping.
# `record_dispatch` (step 6) still mints a fresh nonce and cancels whatever
# was outstanding for the lane on every call (measured, #183 round 3) -- but
# by the time it runs, "whatever was outstanding" is this dispatch's OWN
# claim, not a stranger's, because the claim already closed the window a
# stranger could have used.
CLAIM_TOKEN="$WINDOW_NAME"
# agent-dotfiles#209. Two guards, and they are not the same guard.
#
# CLAIM_LANE: nothing has been claimed yet, so there is nothing to release.
#
# CLAIM_COMMITTED: step 4.5 has marked the claim LIVE and the brief is going
# into a real pane, so this dispatch is no longer unwindable. Past that point
# releasing the claim would free a lane that is actively working --
# #102/#126's failure, caused by the cleanup rather than prevented by it. It
# matters because of the trap below, which fires on the SUCCESS path too: on a
# clean dispatch `record_dispatch`'s own `_register_lane_tx` has already
# cancelled this placeholder, so the release would be a harmless no-op -- but
# when `record_dispatch` FAILS (non-fatal by design, step 6) the placeholder is
# still the only thing holding the lane, and deleting it would hand a working
# lane to the next dispatcher.
#
# THIS FLAG IS A FAST PATH, NOT THE GUARANTEE (agent-dotfiles#209 round 2).
# Round 1 had only this flag, set ~70 lines after the brief was submitted, and
# a signal landing in between freed a working lane. The durable half is now
# step 4.5's `commit-lane-claim`, which moves the row to a status
# `release-lane-claim` is scoped away from -- so even a signal arriving
# between that ledger write and the assignment of this variable is safe, and
# so is a SIGKILL that never lets this shell run anything again.

# dispatch.sh had none. Its four inline `release_lane_claim` calls cover the
# four failures it ENUMERATES; a `kill`, a timeout wrapper, a closed terminal
# or a crashed shell are not among them and left the claim behind.
#
# EXIT alone is not enough, for the reason #187 measured on inbox-poll.sh: an
# untrapped SIGTERM reaches the EXIT trap only when bash happens to be waiting

# AFTER the brief goes live leaves a claim the reap deliberately will not
# clear, so that one case ends at the documented manual recovery rather than
# at an automatic cleanup -- because the alternative is handing the next
# dispatcher a lane with a worker in it, and that is the loss this whole
# subsystem exists to prevent.

# as the comment above already says of the ledger race #184 closed. The same
# gap lets an index silently come to mean another pane, and on 2026-08-12

# THE ROLES THAT MUST KEEP A LIVE PANE, NAMED HERE, IN CODE (#171's own
# brief asks for this, not left in a comment elsewhere): a lane that must be
# INTERRUPTED mid-turn, a lane that must answer an INTERACTIVE PROMPT (a
# usage-limit dialog, a permission request, a menu), or a lane WATCHED AND
# RESUMED BY A HUMAN directly -- `cli.py`'s own `adapter_for_harness` comment
# names the same three. dispatch.sh's own job -- claim an issue, hand a lane
# a brief, collect a PR -- is never one of them (#255 measured this: "almost
# everything in this estate is dispatch-and-collect"), and there is no lane
# PROPERTY this script can read back out of a pane to auto-detect the three
# roles above -- only the human dispatching knows a given call is one of
# them. So `--live-pane` is a CALLER decision (this dispatch keeps the old
# tmux flow below, unchanged), never something inferred from the pane.
#
# WHY THE CANDIDATE IS RELEASED, NOT USED: `$LANE`/`$LANE_TARGET` are a real
# tmux pane from the fixed, standing pool -- one of the "existing lanes"
# #171's brief says not to touch. Routing THIS dispatch over `claude-print`
# instead means that pane is never respawned, never sent a keystroke, and
# never recorded against -- `release_lane_claim` (already wired to this
# script's EXIT trap) clears its ledger claim the moment this branch exits,
# leaving it exactly as free as it was before the loop above found it, for
# a later dispatch (one that passes --live-pane) to actually use.
#
# WHY GATED TO A PLAIN, SINGLE-ISSUE, NON-PR-SCOPED DISPATCH:
# `dispatch-claude-print.sh` (the mechanism this calls into) does not speak
# `--reviews-pr`'s author-exclusion bookkeeping, `--pr`'s PR-scoped source
# recording, or a comma-joined multi-issue list -- see its own usage
# comment. Falling through to the pre-#171 tmux flow for those three shapes
# is a known, tracked scope boundary (agent-supervisor#171), not a silent
# fallback: nothing has failed yet at this point, so this is a routing
# choice made BEFORE any commitment, the opposite of the forbidden kind of
# fallback (a REAL claude-print failure below never falls back to send-keys
# -- see the `exit $?` a few lines down and dispatch-claude-print.sh's own

# from a legitimate refusal, and it aborted the dispatch every time.
#
# CLAIMED holds only what actually got claimed, in claim order, so a failure
# partway through a multi-issue list (agent-dotfiles#112) unwinds exactly the
# issues this dispatch took and none it did not touch. Aborting the WHOLE
# dispatch when any one claim fails, rather than proceeding with a partial
# claim, matches the existing "every failure aborts" contract: a lane already
# dispatched to a partial claim would be actively working issues the estate
# cannot see as taken, which is the exact failure #112 was filed over.
#

# loop entirely -- ITS ISSUE(S) STAY CLAIMED BY THE ORIGINAL WORK, on

# because `claim.sh take` correctly refuses here (the issue IS claimed,
# by the in-flight work that opened the PR under review/fix), and that
# correct refusal was what pushed dispatch to a ledger-invisible tmux
# hand-off. Step 0.6 above is this dispatch's real ownership check, against

# scrolls INTERNALLY, the head disappears from the visible region, and
# `capture-pane` cannot see it however correct the delivery was.
#
# Measured against a real Claude Code TUI at 80x24 (throwaway tmux server, one
# probe per length, never a live lane):
#
#   ~450 chars -> head visible          ~500 chars -> HEAD LOST
#
# The first version of the deliverable contract lived in this string and took
# it to 610 characters. That failed verification 4 times out of 4 at 80x24 and
# passed 3/3 at 126x60 -- and `free-9` and `free-10` are 80x24, so it broke
# dispatch to real lanes while every stub test stayed green (#118 review).
#
# So the contract is NOT in this string. The message is back to 389 characters
# with representative paths, and `MESSAGE_BUDGET` below pins that this stays
# true: the paths are the bulk of it and they vary, so the margin is thin and
# it is enforced rather than remembered.
#
# Built and budget-checked here, BEFORE step 3.5 relaunches the harness: an
# over-budget message means this dispatch is refused regardless of anything
# below, and there is no reason to kill and relaunch a lane's harness only to
# then abort without ever typing into it.

# --- 3.5. put the lane IN its worktree, at the OS level (#15) --------------
#
# Measured on a live codex lane (#15): `lsof -a -p "$(tmux list-panes ... pane_pid)" -d cwd`
# resolved to the SHARED checkout, never the worktree just created above,
# even though the brief typed into the pane a few lines below names the
# worktree and tells the lane to work only there. The harness process
# occupying the pane had its cwd fixed the moment it was execed -- at lane
# creation (`bootstrap-session.sh`'s `new-window -c "$WORKDIR"`) or its last
# relaunch -- and nothing after that point can change a running process's
# cwd from outside it. Typing `cd $WORKTREE` into the pane does not touch
# that cwd: past this point in a lane's life the pane is not a shell, it is
# the harness's own chat input box, and text sent there is a PROMPT, read and
# acted on by the agent, never executed by a shell. A Claude lane usually
# gets away with it because it reasons in absolute paths; a codex lane does
# not, which is exactly how #15 was caught.
#
# So the fix is not a stronger sentence in the brief (#15 already had one,
# and it still failed -- the shape #73/#81/#263 keep closing). It is the same
# mechanism `restore.sh` already uses to put a restored lane in the right
# directory: `-c <dir>` on the tmux call that creates the pane's process,
# which sets the REAL, OS-level starting directory before anything runs in
# it. `restore.sh` gets that for free because it always creates a fresh
# window. `dispatch.sh` reuses an existing lane's window, so the equivalent
# here is `respawn-pane -k -c "$WORKTREE"`: kill whatever the harness left
# running (the pool only ever offers this step a FREE lane -- ledger and
# lanes.sh both said so above -- so there is no live conversation to lose,
# same as `restore.sh`'s own "no open task -> restore fresh" branch) and
# start the harness AS the pane's new process, its adapter's own
# `HARNESS_LAUNCH_CMD` given to the same tmux call as its argv (#236) --
# a real shell command, run as the pane's process directly, which is the one
# place in this script's lifetime a `cd`-shaped instruction is actually
# obeyed by something other than the agent choosing to obey it.
#
# Fails closed: a harness this dispatch cannot identify, or one whose
# adapter records no launch command, is refused rather than dispatched with
# an unverifiable cwd -- the exact failure mode #15 is about, produced on

# to run a pasted, unpinned launch command (the same shape #120/#135 already
# refuse to let this file's OWN launch literal be -- see harness/claude.sh),
# because nothing checked what was listening for those keystrokes a second

# Still structural, which is the whole point of #117: the DISPATCHER writes it

# message because that string has a hard length budget and this text does not
# fit in it; the brief file has no such limit and is the thing the lane is told
# to read.
#
# It also stops the message contradicting itself. Typed at the pane, the
# dispatcher said "that file is your COMPLETE brief" and then added an
# instruction that was not in it -- and for a read-only review brief, "push
# your branch and open a PR" contradicted the brief's own first line. In the
# file it sits with the rest of the instructions and defers to them.

## Delivering this work

Added by \`dispatch.sh\` on every dispatch, not by the brief's author.

Unless this brief says otherwise, when you are finished:
**push your branch and open a PR**.
If you produced no code -- a review, an investigation, an options paper --
**post your findings as a comment** on the issue or PR the brief names.

Do not stop with the work only in your worktree. From outside, a lane that
finished without shipping is indistinguishable from a lane that did nothing:
unshipped work looks exactly like no work, and the worktree is temporary.

# thing dispatch.sh ever types into a lane it did not just create, and #179
# found exactly this box holding a leftover, unsubmitted prompt from
# something else entirely (`merge the PR`, sitting in the author lane's
# input box). Typing `/clear` on top of that appends to it rather than
# clearing anything -- `/clear` is a plain string to the pane, not a key
# tmux interprets -- and #178's diagnosis is that the Enter which follows
# then may not submit either.
#
# VERIFIED, not bare, as of agent-supervisor#193: `/clear`'s own Enter can be
# swallowed exactly the way #178 already found a brief's Enter can be, and
# that failure used to be invisible -- the retyped brief landed glued onto
# the unsubmitted "/clear", and the proof-token check below (an AND-of-
# substrings check with no notion of position) still read it as `landed`

# Type, verify, THEN submit -- send.sh's verified_type, extracted from what
# used to be this loop. The verification is why the Enter is a separate call
# (verified_submit, below the ledger commit): what the pane actually shows
# is the only evidence that the keys landed.
#
# Check BOTH ENDS of the message plus the worktree path -- the proof tokens
# below. The head is what a dropped prefix eats first (observed live,
# 2026-08-11), and it is also the first thing an over-long message hides by
# scrolling -- so checking the head alone conflates "arrived and is visible"
# with "fits". The tail is the part that stays visible under scrolling, so it
# is the half that still reports honestly when the box is full; checking only
# the tail would pass a dropped prefix, which is the failure this loop exists
# for. Both, or neither is evidence.
#
# The tail token is the closing phrase plus $REPO_PATH, not the path alone:
# the harness prints the working directory in its own header, so the bare
# path matches ordinary pane furniture and would pass on a blank pane.
# send.sh strips spaces and newlines from both sides before matching, because
# a real pane wraps a long path across lines and indents the continuation.
#
# The head token is `--proof-head`, not `--proof`, as of agent-supervisor#193:
# the ORIGINAL `--proof "Read $BRIEF"` only checked that the string appeared
# somewhere on the pane, and "somewhere" is exactly what let a corrupted
# `/clearRead $BRIEF...` -- `/clear`'s own Enter swallowed, the retyped brief
# glued onto the unsubmitted line -- read as `landed`: `Read $BRIEF` was
# still a true substring, just not the start of anything. `--proof-head`
# anchors it to the START of the input box's own content instead (see
# send.sh's `_send_head_matches`), so this exact corruption now fails the
# check and falls into the C-u-and-retype loop below rather than shipping.
#
# `--preclear`, as of agent-supervisor#240: `verified_preclear` above already
# confirmed this box empty, but that confirmation covers the instant it was
# taken, not the instant `send-keys` below actually runs -- six lanes were
# measured holding live unsent text that `lanes.sh` had classified `free`,
# `busy` or `broken`, never `unsent`, which is exactly the shape of text
# landing in a gap no earlier check could see. `--proof-head` already
# detects a glued brief and the retry above already recovers it, but that
# recovery costs a whole extra type-and-check round trip every time, and it
# is not the only thing that could go wrong in that gap. A classification --
# `verified_preclear`'s included -- can be wrong; one more `C-u`, sent
# immediately before the keys that matter, cannot be.

# --- 4.5 THE POINT OF NO RETURN, AND IT IS THE SEND -----------------------
# agent-dotfiles#209 round 2. `CLAIM_COMMITTED` used to be set ~70 lines below
# this, after step 5's confirmation loop -- and step 5 costs up to
# DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE (10s by default) of wall clock. So
# for that whole window the lane was renamed and the brief was ABOUT to be
# live, while both cleanup paths still believed the dispatch was unwindable. A
# SIGTERM landing there ran the trap and deleted the claim, and
# `lane_available` answered True for a lane that was actively working -- #102's
# shape produced BY the cleanup, which step 6's own comment below says in its
# own words must not happen. Reproduced against the stubs, both directions, in
# tests/supervisor/test_dispatch.sh.
#
# So the commit happens HERE, before the Enter rather than after the
# confirmation, because "the brief is live" starts at the submit and not at
# the moment the bookkeeping finishes noticing.
#
# IT IS WRITTEN TO THE LEDGER, not just to this shell. `CLAIM_COMMITTED` below
# is only a fast path for the trap; it dies with this process, and the SIGKILL
# case is exactly the one where this process stops existing while the pane
# keeps working. `commit-lane-claim` moves the placeholder to a status both
# `release_lane_claim` and `reap-lane-claims` refuse to touch, so the
# protection survives a kill that no shell can trap. That ordering also means
# a signal arriving BETWEEN the ledger write and the assignment below is
# already safe: the trap's release matches no row.
#
# WHAT THE REORDERING COSTS, stated rather than discovered later. From here
# every failure leaves the lane HELD -- including a send that fails outright,
# and step 5 concluding the brief never left the input box. Those used to free
# the lane. That is deliberate and it is the fail-closed direction: a lane
# wrongly held costs capacity and is recovered by the documented command the
# "no free lane" refusal prints; a lane wrongly freed costs a running lane's
# work and is recovered by nothing. `lanes.sh` still shows such a lane
# `unsent`, so the cost is visible rather than silent.
#
# FATAL IF IT FAILS, and that is the same argument pointing the other way:
# nothing has gone into the pane yet, so refusing is still free, and sending a
# brief we could not first mark as live would leave the exact window this
# block exists to close.

# --- 5. AND THE BRIEF ACTUALLY STARTED ------------------------------------
# #141. Everything above proves the brief was TYPED. Nothing proved it was
# SUBMITTED, and on 2026-08-11 two lanes sat for 40 minutes each holding a
# full brief in the input box because the Enter arrived while `/clear` was
# still repainting and was swallowed. The dispatcher printed
# `dispatch: #N -> lane` and walked away. This is the #81 and #130 shape
# again: the dispatcher's success message is not evidence of dispatch.
#
# What "started" means is measured, not assumed. The obvious check -- wait for
# the footer to show a running shape -- is racy: driving a real Claude Code
# pane through a short turn, `esc to interrupt` was gone from the footer
# within six seconds, so a fast first turn looks exactly like a brief that
# never ran. The input box emptying is the durable signal: it is true while
# the turn runs AND after it finishes, and it is false in precisely the
# failure this exists for.
#
# LATENCY: this loop adds ~DISPATCH_SETTLE (default 1s) to every dispatch,
# even one that lands instantly, because the first sleep runs before the
# first check -- and up to DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE (10s by
# default) to a slow-confirming one. That is the price of #141: it is what
# turns "the dispatcher printed success" into "the box actually went empty",
# so do not tune DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES down to make dispatch feel faster
# without understanding that the loop is what makes an unsent brief
# detectable instead of silent.
# verified_submit sends the Enter itself -- this used to be a separate
# `tmux send-keys ... Enter` call right above step 5's comment block; moving

# after the ledger commit above, still fatal if the send-keys call itself

# above. The reasoning was right and the position was wrong, so the position
# moved; do not move it back. What that reasoning still buys, unchanged, is
# the case below: a `record_dispatch` FAILURE is non-fatal by design and falls
# straight through to the exit, where the EXIT trap runs -- and the claim
# placeholder is then the only thing keeping a working lane out of the next
# dispatcher's hands. Step 4.5's ledger commit is what makes both the trap and
# the reap leave it alone.

# --- 6. record what was dispatched. BEST EFFORT, NEVER FATAL --------------
#
# agent-dotfiles#140, updated by agent-dotfiles#174. Every signal that a lane
# is busy used to be inferred from pane content, and inference is what
# produced the false-`free` bugs #102, #123 and #126. This writes the fact
# down instead.
#
# #140 made this write non-fatal because NOTHING READ IT YET -- a recording
# layer nothing depends on can be wrong without taking the estate down. That
# premise is gone: step 1 above now reads exactly this record to pick every
# future lane, and #174 was filed to make that inversion explicit rather than
# leave this comment asserting the opposite of what the code now does. Read
# what follows as "still non-fatal, for a DIFFERENT reason", not as the old
# reason left unexamined.
#
# THIS BLOCK STILL MUST NOT ABORT THE DISPATCH, AND THAT IS STILL THE
# OPPOSITE OF EVERY OTHER STEP ABOVE. The brief has already been typed,
# verified and submitted into a REAL, LIVE pane by the time this block runs --
# unwinding the claim and the worktree here would strand a worker that is
# actively working, which is strictly worse than a stale ledger row. So the
# failure mode this block accepts is not "the estate may dispatch to a lane
# that is actually busy" -- it is "this ONE lane stops being offered until
# reconciliation happens". That cost is bounded and visible (the LOUD message
# below, and `lanes.sh` still showing the window doing nothing); trading the
# live worker for it would not be. Do not "fix" it into an abort_send;
# tests/supervisor/test_dispatch.sh mutation-checks that removing this
# tolerance turns the suite red.
#
# agent-dotfiles#188 finding 1: step 1's fail-closed read does NOT rule out
# "actually busy" on its own here. `Ledger.record_dispatch` is one
# transaction, so a failure rolls back every one of its five writes -- and
# for a lane the ledger already had registered free (every lane after its
# first backfill, and every lane `lane-done.sh` has ever freed, which is
# ordinary steady state, not an edge case), rollback restores exactly that
# pre-existing FREE row, not UNKNOWN. A comment here used to claim the
# unrecorded lane reads UNKNOWN regardless; it does not, and #188 is the
# defect that shape produces (also #145, #170: a comment asserting a
# protection the code does not have). `cli.py`'s `record_dispatch` now closes
# that window itself -- on any failure it calls `Ledger.mark_lane_held`
# before re-raising, which writes a placeholder outstanding task for the
# lane so `lane_available` reads occupied, not whatever it read before the
# call. That write happens inside the Python process handling this exact
# failure, so it is not conditional on this bash block at all; what follows
# here is only the loud, human-facing report of what already happened.
#
# WHY IT RUNS LAST, after the final Enter and past every abort path: a record
# asserting work is in flight, left behind by a dispatch that then aborted, is
# worse than no record at all -- the point of the ledger is to be believed.
# Ordering is what guarantees that, not cleanup, so nothing above this line
# needs an unwind for it.
#
# That is also why step 5 (#141) sits ABOVE this block rather than below it.
# Step 5 can abort_send -- a brief that was typed but never submitted unwinds
# the claim and the worktree -- and a ledger record written before it would be
# exactly the "work is in flight" claim this paragraph rules out, asserted
# about a lane that is running nothing.
