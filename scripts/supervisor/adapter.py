# Harness identity, once known, is a RECORDED fact -- written down at the one
# place it is actually decided: `bootstrap-session.sh` (the operator names
# the harness a lane's window starts with), `cli.py register` (an operator
# names it by hand), or `lane_free`'s own first-sight backfill of a pane
# option one of those two already set. It is never solely inferred here
# (agent-dotfiles#216).
#
# This table is the PLAUSIBILITY CHECK `_command_matches` runs against a
# harness already on record; it does not decide what a lane IS. Every
# Node-based harness's process reads "node" in `#{pane_current_command}` --
# confirmed live for both copilot and codex (#216's own measurement, window 8
# ran codex under `node`) -- so a bare command name cannot tell them apart
# from each other, and the table says so by listing "node" for both. What it
# still catches: a lane recorded "claude" whose pane is running anything
# other than the claude binary -- exactly the case #216's mutation-check
# asks for (register the wrong harness, confirm something refuses).

# Matches on a quoted phrase anywhere in a 25-line capture window, the same
# wide-window anti-pattern #65 fixed lanes.sh to avoid (docs/supervisor-
# disposition.md §3). Measured there: a healthy lane quoting "Should I
# proceed?" or a PR body's own text reads back as approval/blocked.
#
# It has real callers, right here: TmuxAdapter.assign_task, .observe_lane,
# and .notify_supervisor -- the last of which calls it twice, once to
# check the pane is idle before sending and once after to confirm the send
# landed. What routes around it is one level up -- dispatch.sh's dispatch
# path (via cli.py's `record_dispatch` command) deliberately calls the
# ledger's `dispatch` recorder instead of `assign_task`, precisely to keep
# this function's defect out of the dispatch flow. See `record_dispatch`'s
# own docstring in cli.py, which names #131 as the change that took pane
# inference OUT of that path. "Routed around on purpose."
#
# That makes this the opposite of the nothing-calls-it defect dispatch.sh's
# header describes: the implementation is unfit to call, not merely uncalled.
# See dispatch.sh's header for the refined test this instance motivated.
# Do not wire a new caller through here without first rebuilding this to
# lanes.sh's standard (docs/supervisor-disposition.md:359, agent-dotfiles#222).
#
# agent-dotfiles#215 is the first issue to take that instruction as written.
# It reported watchdog.sh's Claude-only busy literal as "the general solution
# exists and nothing calls it", and pointed here. watchdog.sh's probe was
# rebuilt per-harness and fail-closed WITHOUT routing through this function --
# deliberately, and recorded at both ends: this function's 25-line quoted-
# phrase window is the #65 anti-pattern the watchdog must not inherit, and it
# raises on any harness other than claude/codex, which inside a bash `if` is a
# non-zero exit, i.e. "not busy" -- reintroducing the exact failure direction
# #215 exists to remove. It reads the same harness/*.sh adapters lanes.sh
# reads, via harness-registry.sh. See watchdog.sh's own #215 section.

    Per SPEC §15.1 the core owns the ledger and lifecycle; this class only

    `TmuxAdapter` scrapes pane scrollback to guess a lane's state and relies
    on the agent to self-report completion via a separate `complete` CLI
    call, ACP's `session/prompt` already blocks until the agent reaches a
    structured `stopReason` -- so assignment and completion happen in one
    round trip here, and there is no pane to classify as idle/active between
    calls (`observe_lane` is a deliberate no-op).

    The CLI dispatches one process per command, so there is no long-lived
    transport to hold onto between calls the way `TmuxAdapter` holds a
    `TmuxTransport` for the process lifetime. `transport_factory` is called
    fresh for every operation (production wiring: `ACPTransport.spawn`) and
    the resulting transport is always closed before returning -- a later
    call resumes the same agent-side session via `ACPTransport.load_session`
    using the session id stored as the lane's `pane_id` at registration.

    `ACPAdapter` this class does not own the harness outright; `cli.py`
    chooses between the two by the lane's recorded `transport`, not its
    `harness` alone.

    Shares ACPAdapter's shape for the reason `pi_transport.py`'s module

    `PiRPCTransport.send_literal` itself waits out the async

class ClaudePrintAdapter:
    """`claude -p`-driven sibling to `PiRPCAdapter`/`ACPAdapter`, for `claude`
    lanes registered with `transport='claude-print'` (agent-supervisor#171).
    `claude` is the one harness that may be driven either way -- plain
    `send-keys` via `TmuxAdapter`, the same as every standing, watched lane
    Jon relies on, or this headless dispatch-and-collect surface -- so, like
    `PiRPCAdapter` does for `pi`, this class does not own the harness
    outright; `cli.py` still chooses between the two by the lane's recorded
    `transport`, never by `harness` alone.

    Unlike `ACPAdapter`/`PiRPCAdapter`, there is no long-lived protocol
    session to resume mid-call: `claude -p` is a single process that runs a
    turn to completion and exits (see `claude_print_transport.py`'s module
    docstring). So `deliver_task` does not "load" a session before sending --
    it hands the recorded `session_id` to a fresh transport as the `--resume`
    target and lets `ClaudePrintTransport.run` do the one subprocess call.

    agent-supervisor#278: `assign_task` and delivery used to be one method,
    one round trip -- `claude -p` already blocks until the turn is genuinely
    done, so there was "no pane to poll in between" and the whole thing ran
    inside a single `operation_lock()`. Measured live: that made a real
    dispatch indistinguishable from a hang from OUTSIDE this process too --
    `dispatch.sh`/`dispatch-claude-print.sh` called `assign_task` and got
    nothing back until the entire task finished, sometimes many minutes
    later, and it held the ledger's one process-wide flock for that whole
    span. Split in two: `assign_task` writes `assigned` -> `delivery_pending`
    and returns (fast, the ledger row a caller can already observe);
    `deliver_task` does the actual blocking `claude -p` turn and the
    `delivered` -> `complete` transition, called separately -- by
    `dispatch-claude-print.sh` backgrounded, or inline when `--wait` asks for
    the old synchronous behaviour.
