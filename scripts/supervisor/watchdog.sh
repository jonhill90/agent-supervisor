# Restarts the architecture supervisor loop when it has died with work left.
#
# It is a WATCHDOG, not the loop. The loop is event-driven; this only catches
# the case where it stopped and nobody noticed. Never make this the mechanism —
# a 3-minute timer driving real work is what exhausted the weekly limit twice
# (see loop-throughput-comes-from-lanes-not-cadence in the memory vault).
#
# Rewritten 2026-08-11 after a four-reviewer council (Codex/gpt-5.6-sol,
# Claude, Copilot, Pi/gpt-5.5), each given a different lens. Three findings
# were confirmed with evidence and are fixed here:
#
#   1. GitHub failure was counted as zero work.  `n=$(gh ...) || n=0` turned an
#      unreachable API into "nothing actionable" — indistinguishable from a
#      genuinely empty queue. This matters specifically because `gh` keeps its
#      token in the macOS keyring, which a cron job frequently cannot read.
#      Evidenced: the 04:18:02Z tick logged "nothing actionable" while eleven
#      actionable items were open. Now a query failure marks the tick DEGRADED
#      and fails TOWARD restarting, because a stalled loop costs more than a
#      redundant restart.
#   2. Silent on the healthy path.  Healthy-and-busy, dead-cron, and
#      nothing-to-do all looked identical: no new log line. Now every tick
#      writes STATUS atomically, so one `cat` answers "where are we" and a
#      stale timestamp proves the cron itself has stopped.
#   3. No escalation.  Restarting forever hides the bug it is papering over.
#      After MAX_RESTARTS in ESCALATE_WINDOW it stops restarting, says so in
#      STATUS, and leaves the loop down for a human.
#
# Cost when healthy: one tmux read, one status write, zero model tokens.

# --- #215: which harness is in the pane, and is it busy? --------------------
#
# This script used to answer "is it busy?" with one Claude Code literal --
# `grep -q 'esc to interrupt'` -- in two places, with no harness parameter and
# no third outcome. On a pane that does not paint that exact string the check
# fell through to NOT BUSY, so a mid-turn lane read as a dead one and this
# script's whole purpose inverted: the watchdog acts on idle, so a false idle
# is an intervention against a working lane. Copilot's own busy footer is
# `◎ Working esc interrupt` -- `esc interrupt`, no "to" -- which is exactly the
# near miss a shared literal does not survive. Latent today (the pane watched
# by default is the Claude supervisor loop), live the moment the supervisor
# itself runs on another harness, which is the stated goal.
#
# WHY NOT adapter.py's `classify_capture`, which #215 points at. Because the
# test for an adapter is "is the implementation fit to be called?", not "is
# there a caller?" (agent-dotfiles#223). `classify_capture` matches quoted
# phrases anywhere in a 25-line window -- the wide-window anti-pattern #65
# fixed lanes.sh to avoid, where a lane merely QUOTING "Should I proceed?"
# reads back as blocked -- its own header says not to wire a new caller
# through it before it is rebuilt to lanes.sh's standard, and
# docs/supervisor-disposition.md §5 lists that rebuild as outstanding work.
# It also models only claude and codex; a copilot pane would make it RAISE,
# and a raising classifier inside a bash `if` is a non-zero exit, which is
# "not busy" again. Wiring it in here would have imported the defect.
#
# So: the same harness/*.sh adapters lanes.sh uses, via harness-registry.sh --
# already the estate's fit, tested, per-harness seam -- and a probe with THREE
# outcomes rather than two. `unknown` is the important one: an unrecognised
# harness, an unreadable capture, a harness whose adapter declines to model a
# busy shape, or no adapters at all all resolve to "cannot tell", and every
# caller below treats cannot-tell as busy. A false busy costs one skipped
# tick; a false idle costs a working lane its turn.

# `inbox-poll.sh` writes `inbox-poll.status` every iteration and pages Jon
# itself from `trap report_stop EXIT` -- but a SIGKILL, an OOM kill, or a hard
# power loss runs no trap at all, so `checked:` simply stops moving. This
# watchdog is the natural external observer: it already runs unattended every
# 180s and already reads-a-status-file-and-decides-if-something-is-overdue for
# the supervisor loop itself (see report()/the escalate branch below).
#
# What watches THIS watcher: nothing does, to the same degree (#170). Every
# tick writes its own `checked:` line to watchdog.status via report() above,
# but no code reads THAT line for staleness -- watchdog_notify.py's
# `--mode heartbeat` reads inbox-poll.status, not watchdog.status, and
# `--mode escalate` (the default, called from report() below) only fires on
# `state: escalate`; it never compares `checked:` against a threshold. The
# LaunchAgent, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jonhill.supervisor-watchdog.plist,
# has `StartInterval` 180 and `RunAtLoad`, and no `KeepAlive` key. If it stops
# firing -- unloaded, launchd killed, the machine off -- nothing pages

# --- advancing the code this watchdog itself runs from ---------------------
#
# The LaunchAgent runs this file out of a PINNED detached worktree
# ($SUPERVISOR_LIVE). Nothing about a merge updates that worktree, so the
# `code:` line above exists to say how far behind it is. For a while that was
# the whole story: report the drift, and let the supervisor loop run
# advance-live.sh once per tick to act on it.
#
# That put the fixer in the component that goes down. The loop is exactly what
# stops running when something is wrong -- and during a deliberate escalation
# it is down BY DESIGN -- so the live worktree stopped advancing precisely
# during the incidents it most needed to be current for. The guard ran its
# stalest code in the one situation it exists to handle. Observed 2026-08-11:
# `1 behind origin/main` held across an escalation while the loop slept; the
# missed commit was benign, and would not have been if it had been a fix to
# this file.
#
# The objection this design was originally rejected over is real and is
# answered by the gate, not by refusing to deploy: "a broken watchdog would
# reinstall itself every 180s and nothing would be left to notice."
# advance-live.sh does not move the pin until the candidate commit's OWN
# watchdog.sh has been run from a throwaway worktree and has written a
# well-formed status. A candidate that cannot run cannot be installed, so the
# copy that would be left unable to notice anything never becomes live. That
# check is not reimplemented here; this calls the one script that owns it.
#
# WHY ON THE WAY OUT, AND NOT AT THE TOP:
#   1. Every duty of this tick is already done. An advance can therefore not
#      cost the tick its status write, its restart, or its page.
#   2. advance-live.sh only advances in the window just after a watchdog tick,
#      read from watchdog.status's own `checked:` line. Called at the top of a
#      tick it would read the PREVIOUS tick's timestamp -- ~180s old, outside
#      the window -- and skip forever. Called here it reads the line this tick
#      just wrote.
#   3. Bash reads a script incrementally, by file offset. Checking out over
#      the file a running bash is still reading is how a script executes
#      garbage. An EXIT trap is the one place where nothing further will be
#      read from this file: the trap body is already in memory and the shell
#      exits when it returns. For the same reason advance-live.sh is run from
#      a COPY -- it lives beside this file and would otherwise be overwritten
#      mid-run by its own checkout.
#   4. Most ticks exit early (working / asleep / waiting_on_jon). A call
#      placed inline at the bottom would only ever run on the restart path.
#
# AND ONLY FROM THE PINNED COPY. The identity check below is what keeps this
# from checking out over a developer's own checkout during a test run, and
# what stops the smoke run advance-live.sh performs -- which executes a
# candidate watchdog.sh, this code included -- from recursing into a second
# advance.
#
# DURING AN ESCALATION, IT HOLDS. This is a deliberate choice against the
# opposite one, so the argument belongs here rather than the conclusion alone:
#
#   For advancing: escalation is when stale guard code is most dangerous, and
#   if the escalation is caused by a watchdog bug, the fix sitting on main is
#   the thing that ends it.
#
#   Against, and decisive: escalation is the ONE state in which a human has
#   already been paged. Staleness is then bounded by a person who is on their
#   way and who can run advance-live.sh by hand; that is how the live worktree
#   was advanced before any of this was automated. Set against that bound, the
#   cost of advancing is unbounded: the sha in the status file a human was
#   paged with must still be the sha they find when they look, or they are
#   debugging a system that is rewriting itself underneath the diagnosis. A
#   merge is also a leading suspect for whatever made the loop die three times
#   in an hour, and pulling further changes into a live incident is the way to
#   turn one unknown into several. Freezing is trivially reversible by hand;
#   redeploying mid-diagnosis is not reversible at all in the sense that
#   matters, because the confusion has already happened.
#
#   Residual risk, named rather than papered over: if the page never got out
#   (`notify:` says FAILED) nobody is coming, and the freeze outlasts the
#   incident. That is bounded by this watchdog retrying the page every tick.
#   Gating the hold on delivery was considered and rejected: it makes whether
#   the estate deploys itself depend on whether a phone had signal.
