# --- #136: two uncoordinated callers advancing the same live worktree -------
# Since #132 there are two callers -- loop-tick.md's step 0 and watchdog.sh's
# exit trap -- and the normal case is the watchdog running from the pinned copy
# at the moment a supervisor tick begins. #136 filed that as low severity on the
# reasoned claim that the worst case is bounded by git's own `index.lock`: one
# `git checkout --detach` fails cleanly and is reported as a refusal, never
# corruption. The two blocks below turn that reasoning into assertions.
#
# They are separate claims and are deliberately kept separate:
#   A. THE MECHANISM. `index.lock` is held by the test, so the refusal fires on
#      every run. This proves what advance-live.sh does when the checkout is
#      locked out; it does NOT prove two real invocations ever reach that point.
#   B. THE RACE. Two invocations really do run concurrently from a shared
#      barrier, with the second caller staggered across the same start-offset
#      sweep (0-0.12s) that #148's one-off 200-iteration experiment used to
#      land collisions reliably -- #150 found that sweep existed only in the
#      one-off run and never made it into this file, so the committed test
#      (a bare simultaneous release) collided only ~7.5% of runs. This asserts
#      only the invariants that must hold whether or not a collision fires,
#      and reports the observed collision count without asserting it is
#      nonzero: asserting "a collision occurred" here would fail the suite on
#      a CI runner that merely scheduled two processes politely, which is a
#      flaky test, not a stronger one (#150). A zero-collision run is logged
#      explicitly instead, so that outcome is itself checked rather than a
#      silent pass -- the deterministic mechanism test above (section A) pins
#      the refusal handling regardless of whether this run's race collided.

# The watchdog's own restart-on-crash defect (#130) got #132: the watchdog
# advances its OWN pinned worktree every tick. inbox-poll.sh is the estate's
# other long-running process and got no equivalent (#187) -- this exercises
# the fix, which lives here rather than in inbox-poll.sh itself (see this
# file's own header). tmux is stubbed throughout: nothing here ever reaches
# a real tmux server, let alone the live poller in agent-dotfiles:11 -- the
# brief for this work says explicitly not to touch that pane, and a fake
# `tmux` on PATH is how that is guaranteed rather than merely intended.
