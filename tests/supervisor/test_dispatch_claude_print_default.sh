#!/bin/bash
# dispatch.sh -- the NORMAL path, never dispatch-claude-print.sh by hand --
# must default a fresh, plain, single-issue `claude` dispatch onto
# `claude-print`, not the candidate lane's tmux pane (agent-supervisor#171).
#
# WHY: #171/#215/#255 measured that flipping `_TRANSPORTS_BY_HARNESS`'s
# tuple order alone would be a LIE -- `Ledger.record_dispatch` (the write
# dispatch.sh's tmux flow makes) never changes what physically delivers a
# brief, so relabelling its default transport without also changing the
# delivery mechanism would record `claude-print` for a lane a human is
# actually typing into. This suite proves the real thing: dispatch.sh,
# called exactly as any other caller calls it (no dispatch-claude-print.sh
# by hand), (1) leaves a freshly selected `claude` candidate's tmux pane
# completely untouched -- no rename-window, no send-keys, still free in the
# ledger afterward -- and (2) produces a SEPARATE, brand-new lane whose
# ledger row reads transport=claude-print and whose task reaches complete,
# purely from `claude`'s own argv, never a keystroke. It also proves the
# opt-out (--live-pane), that a harness with no claude-print transport at
# all (codex) is unaffected, that a multi-issue dispatch falls through to
# the pre-#171 tmux flow (a documented scope boundary, not a silent
# fallback), and that a broken `claude` refuses rather than silently
# falling back to send-keys.
