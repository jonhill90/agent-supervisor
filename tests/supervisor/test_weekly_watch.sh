# tolerate a flaky codexbar sample without missing a threshold, and must
# never silently mark a failed page as sent (agent-supervisor#327).
#
# Same discipline as test_quota_watch_blind_alarm.sh: the real script runs
# with --once-per-invocation semantics (it has no loop of its own -- launchd
# ticks it), so each `tick` call below is exactly one real invocation, and
# the state machine has to get its dedup right across ticks, not just
# within one process.
