# dispatch.sh must be the thing that CALLS lanes.sh, claim.sh and worktree.sh,
# so a lane cannot be handed work without a worktree of its own.
#
# WHY: agent-dotfiles#81. worktree.sh was built for #73 and, at the time, no
# script invoked `new`, `done` or `guard` -- the only references to it were
# three code fences in loop-tick.md and a section of the supervisor README.
# Enforcement was "the dispatcher reads the file and runs the command", which
# is the same mechanism whose failure produced #73 in the first place. The
# lesson from acp_transport.py (tested, zero importers) and from claim.sh
# (#74, wired the same day it landed) is that a tool with no caller is a
# documentation rule with a binary attached.
#
# The load-bearing test here is `a failed worktree aborts the dispatch`: if
# worktree.sh new fails and the brief goes out anyway, the lane works in the
# shared checkout, which IS #73. Sending nothing is the correct outcome.

# agent-dotfiles#174: dispatch.sh now READS the ledger to pick a lane, where
# before this suite was written it only ever WROTE to it (#140, nothing read
# it back). Every case in this file that dispatches to lane t:3 under the
# implicit default state dir used to be independent BY ACCIDENT -- nothing
# read the previous case's leftover ledger row, so it did not matter that
# they shared one. Now it would: a second dispatch to t:3 under a ledger that
# still shows the first one's task open would be correctly refused as
# occupied, breaking every case below that expects a second dispatch to
# succeed under the SAME implicit state dir. Each call gets an UNSHARED
# default state dir via `mktemp`, so every case that has not opted into a
# shared one via LEDGER_STATE keeps testing exactly what it tested before
# this landed -- one dispatch, in isolation. Cases that explicitly set
# LEDGER_STATE (to inspect what a specific dispatch recorded, or to force a
# broken ledger) are unaffected; they never relied on the implicit default.
#
# `mktemp -d`, not a counter: `run()` is almost always called as
# `out=$(run ...)`, and command substitution forks a SUBSHELL -- a counter
# variable incremented inside `run()` would increment only that subshell's
# copy and never advance in the parent, so every call would compute the same
# "next" value. `mktemp` needs no shared, persistent state to stay unique.

# --- A LEDGER *WRITE* FAILURE STILL DOES NOT ABORT A DISPATCH -------------
#
# #140's original property, narrowed by #174 rather than dropped: once a lane
# is ALREADY known free (so step 1 needed no write of its own -- see the
# lane-free command's docstring), a dispatch proceeds through claim, worktree
# and a real, verified send before step 6 ever touches the ledger again. If
# THAT final write fails, the brief has already reached a live pane; unwinding
# the claim and the worktree at that point would strand a worker that is
# actually running, which is worse than one stale ledger row. See step 6's
# own comment for the full argument.
#
# The break is deliberately an APPLICATION-level conflict, not a filesystem
# one: a task already exists under the exact id this dispatch's window name
# will produce (`ad148-ledger-write-broken`), assigned to a DIFFERENT lane.
# `Ledger.record_dispatch`'s own assign step refuses that outright (agent-
# dotfiles#144 finding 2's docstring). A read-only sqlite file was tried
# first and dropped: whether SQLite's WAL machinery lets a given read
# through after the main file is chmod'd read-only turned out to depend on
# per-process lock/checkpoint state and was not deterministic across
# separate `cli.py` invocations -- exactly the kind of flake this suite
# should not carry. Reads (step 0, step 1) are untouched by this seed; only
# the write `record-dispatch` performs at the very end collides.

# WHY: `declare -A WINDOW_NAME_BY_INDEX` used to be rejected by macOS's real
# /bin/bash (3.2, no associative arrays), which prints straight to stderr on
# every dispatch and reads exactly like a broken guard on the command that
# decides where work goes -- see #199. `run()` above launches dispatch.sh
# with whatever `bash` PATH resolves to, which is a modern bash on most dev
# machines and never hits the bug; this case runs the script directly so
# its own `#!/bin/bash` shebang picks the interpreter, matching how the
# supervisor actually invokes it in production, and asserts stderr is empty
# on a dispatch that succeeds. That is the regression guard: it is what
# would catch the next 3.2-incompatible construct landing on this path.

# --- agent-dotfiles#184: two dispatchers racing the SAME candidate lane ---
#
# Every case above dispatches once, in isolation -- the second dispatcher
# never exists. #184 is specifically about what happens when it does: two
# dispatchers can both read `lanes.sh --free` + `cli.py lane-free` and see
# the SAME lane free before either one finishes acting on it. A test that
# only calls dispatch.sh twice IN SEQUENCE proves nothing (the second call
# losing is what happens either way) -- this drives dispatcher A into the
# stub, splices a WHOLE second dispatch (dispatcher B, for a different
# issue, against the real unmodified dispatch.sh) in via a test-only hook
# right after A reads the lane free and before A can act on that read, and
# only then lets A continue. That is "dispatcher A reads availability, then
# B completes a whole dispatch, then A sends" -- #184's own required shape,
# not two calls back to back.
#
# DISPATCH_TEST_RACE_HOOK is dispatch.sh's only concession to this: a command
# run with the candidate lane as $1, at exactly the point a second dispatcher
# would need to land a competing dispatch to prove the race. No caller sets
# it outside this file.

# it fails. A race that needs A and B to land on TWO DIFFERENT lanes (this
# one) seeds two free lanes, so A's loop tries a SECOND candidate after

# --- agent-dotfiles#209: a dispatcher killed between claim and release -----
#
# Everything above proves that every abort path dispatch.sh ENUMERATES
# releases its lane claim. #209 is about the paths it cannot enumerate: a
# `kill`, an OOM, a closed terminal, a host crash. The placeholder
# `claim_lane` writes is a task with status `created`, and `lane_available`
# counts any non-terminal status as occupied -- so a dispatcher that dies
# holding one leaves the lane reading occupied with nothing working it. That
# is agent-dotfiles#102's failure shape (dispatch capacity silently falling to
# zero while lanes sit idle) reached through the mechanism built to prevent
# it, and it was hand-reconciled nine times in two days before this test
# existed.
#
# The kill is delivered by standing in for `python3` (DISPATCH_PYTHON, which
# dispatch.sh already reads) and signalling the DISPATCHER the instant its
# claim has committed -- the exact instant the gap opens. No new seam in
# dispatch.sh, and the victim is named by the `--owner-pid` argument the claim
# itself carries, so the test cannot kill the wrong process.

# --- agent-dotfiles#209 round 2: the point of no return is the SEND -------
#
# Every case above signals the dispatcher right after `claim-lane`, which is
# the EARLIEST instant the claim exists -- nothing has been typed, no lane has
# been renamed, and freeing the claim there is correct. None of them signals
# after the brief is live, and that absence is what let the first round of
# this fix ship with the cleanup pointed at the wrong instant.
#
# The re-review's measurement: the trap and the reap both treated
# `CLAIM_COMMITTED` (set after step 5's confirmation loop) as the point of no
# return, but the brief goes live ~70 lines earlier, at the `send-keys Enter`
# that submits it -- up to DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE (10s by
# default) of wall clock in between. A signal landing in that window ran the
# trap and deleted the claim AFTER the lane had been renamed and the brief

# WHY: this issue's own live evidence. A lane wrote a fix pass for a PR
# under a SEPARATE tracking issue (the review-findings issue, #178 here --
# not the PR's own originating issue, #186) and was later free to be handed
# that PR's re-review. The single-author lookup, resolved by the PR's own
# issue (#186), never sees a task filed under a DIFFERENT issue at all --
# and the WORKTREE fallback that COULD have caught it (the fix-pass task's
# worktree was checked out on the exact branch under review) used to run
# ONLY when the issue-based lookup came up silent. #186's own author WAS
# findable there, so the worktree fallback never ran, and the fix-pass
# lane's contribution went unchecked.
#
# Modelled with two REAL dispatches (via `run()`, not a hand-built ledger
# row) so the worktree-on-branch state is the real thing dispatch.sh's own
# `git worktree list` will see, the same technique #117's own test above
# uses: the fix-pass worktree is renamed onto the PR's actual branch after
# the original author's own worktree is torn down -- exactly what happens

  # Read at `merge-base HEAD origin/main`, NOT literal `HEAD`: this test's

  # widening" the moment that commit lands, and `git show HEAD:...` would
  # silently fetch the FIXED script instead of the one it means to revert
  # (measured directly: this exact test read its own fix back once the
  # commit landed). The merge-base is the shared ancestor with main -- the
  # pre-widening script -- regardless of how many commits sit on top here.
  #
  # `origin/main` is not guaranteed to already resolve. A CI checkout of a

  # while passing on every dev machine that happened to have a full clone --
  # the second sighting of the shape PR #194's reviewer had already set aside
  # once, wrongly, as a local-clone artifact). Resolve it ourselves: use an
  # already-resolvable ref if there is one, else fetch main with an explicit
  # refspec (a bare `fetch origin main` on a single-branch clone updates
  # FETCH_HEAD only, never `refs/remotes/origin/main`, and would look like a
  # no-op success while changing nothing -- measured directly here). If the

# `<session>:<index>`, so 526 task rows now name a lane that -- AS A STRING --
# no longer exists, while the WINDOW each of them names is still there, under
# the new session name. The author-exclusion guard compared those strings, so
# `agent-dotfiles:3` never equalled `agent-supervisor:3` and the guard stopped
# excluding the one window it was pointed at: a self-review would be dispatched
# and reported as independent.
#
# Modelled exactly that way, with nothing else moved: the authoring dispatch
# runs under session `old`, the review under session `t`, against ONE shared
# ledger. The fixture is the same file both times -- same windows, same panes,
# same indices -- because a rename changes the session's LABEL and nothing else.

# --- agent-dotfiles#225: does the existing stderr-clean guard (#199) catch

#
# The brief asks this explicitly: #199's assertion is `[ -z "$err" ]` over a
# SUCCESSFUL dispatch's stderr, and both of finding 2's sites only run at
# all on the --reviews-pr path, which #199's own case never takes (it
# dispatches ordinary work, no --reviews-pr). So the existing guard's reach
# does not cover this: it was never exercised against this path, not
# defeated by it. The dedicated cases above are what actually catch it.

# review -------------------------------------------------------------------

# supervisor forgot it three times in one day (PR #62 twice, #69 once),
# dispatching a self-review every time. This exercises the exact same #212
# refusal reached WITHOUT the flag: dispatch.sh infers it from the issue
# title's own "review PR #<N>" shape (the shape every review issue in this
# estate's history already uses -- see the #212/#35 fixtures above).

# WHY: the measured incident. Task `as101-reviewspr-inference` produced PR
# branch `fix/101-not-a-review-escape` -- reconstructing a task id from that
# branch name (`${PREFIX}101-not-a-review-escape`) never matches the real
# task id, so the old fallback refused a review the ledger could actually
# answer. This reproduces the divergence directly: dispatch a real task,
# then RENAME its real worktree's branch (the way a lane renames its
# checkout to satisfy the type-prefix convention with a slug of its own
# choosing) to something sharing no text with the dispatch slug, and give
# the review a PR whose "Fixes #<N>" line names an issue the ledger has NO
# record of at all -- so the issue-keyed lookup (steps 1/2) is silenced on
# purpose, and only a worktree-based lookup can resolve this.

# --- agent-supervisor#101: an inferred review must be escapable without
# rewording the brief --------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY: #70's inference reads prose, and prose ABOUT a PR is not a review OF
# that PR. Measured on this estate: a rebase dispatch whose brief said
# "rebase it so it can be reviewed" next to "PR #93" was read as a review of
# #93 and then refused on authorship grounds -- for a task where authorship is
# irrelevant (a rebase by a non-author is normal). The operator escaped by
# rewording the brief, which teaches writing around the tool.
#
# The fix does NOT narrow detection: every narrowing available reads the same
# prose and would drop real reviews #70 catches today, which is the dangerous
# direction. It adds `--not-a-review`, said at the dispatch instead of in the
# brief. The cases below hold BOTH directions: the escape works, and with the
# escape absent the same brief is still inferred and still excludes the author.

# --- agent-supervisor#159: a PR-scoped dispatch does not need its ISSUE ---
#
# WHY: a review of PR N, or a fix pass on PR N, is not new work on a fresh
# issue -- it is work ON THE PR, and the issue that PR closes (or the
# tracking issue a reviewer was handed) is correctly already claimed by the
# in-flight work. `claim.sh take` refusing that was correct FOR ITS OWN
# MODEL; the model was missing a dispatchable representation of "work on PR
# N" distinct from "work on issue N". Three real collisions (measured, see
# the issue) came from working around that refusal with a ledger-bypassing
# tmux hand-off instead of fixing the model: #142's fix pass, #157's review,
# #149's fix pass, the last two landing with a literal "b"-suffixed second
# task id because nothing could see the first one was already there.
#
# RED FIRST (acceptance #3): before this PR, case 1 below failed exactly the
# way the issue quotes -- `claim.sh take` on the review's own issue refused
# because it actually was already claimed, and the whole dispatch aborted.
# Verified by hand: `git stash` on dispatch.sh/cli.py/core.py and re-running
# this section reproduces exit 1 with "is not available -- pick different
# work" for case 1, "cannot tell which harness" is never reached. Restoring
# the stash turns it green. That stash/restore is not re-run by this suite
# (there would be nothing left here to assert against a script that no
# longer exists), so this comment is the record of it.

# --- agent-supervisor#308: the FIFTH resolution path -- a `--pr`-scoped ---
# fix-pass lane is a genuine contributor and must be excluded from later
# reviewing the SAME PR, even though it was never dispatched by ISSUE and
# its own worktree was never checked out on the PR's actual head branch.
#
# WHY: the motivating incident, reproduced directly. `as284-as302rev3` and
# `as284-as302fix2` were both `--pr 302` fix passes -- exactly case 2 above
# (line ~3480) -- but nothing ever tested whether a LATER `--reviews-pr`
# review of that same PR actually excludes them. RED FIRST: before this
# change, step 1&2 (issue-keyed) finds the ORIGINAL author via the PR's
# "Fixes #<issue>" line, but the fix-pass lane's own dispatch was recorded
# `source_kind='pull'`, invisible to that query -- and its worktree's branch
# (`lane/<slug>`, `worktree.sh new`'s own default, never renamed to the PR's
# real head branch, which in this shape belongs to nobody's worktree at
# all) cannot resolve it via step 3 either. So the fix-pass lane reads as a
# stranger and would be handed the review of its own fix -- the exact #190
# harm, on a path #190 could not see because #159 (PR-scoped dispatch) did
# not exist yet when #190 shipped.
