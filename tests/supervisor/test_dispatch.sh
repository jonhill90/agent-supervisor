# dispatch.sh must be the thing that CALLS lanes.sh, claim.sh and worktree.sh,
# so a lane cannot be handed work without a worktree of its own.
#
# WHY: agent-dotfiles#81. worktree.sh was built for #73 and, at the time, no
# script invoked `new`, `done` or `guard` -- the only references to it were
# three code fences in loop-tick.md and a section of the supervisor README.
# Enforcement was "the dispatcher reads the file and runs the command", which
# is the same mechanism whose failure produced #73 in the first place. The
# lesson from acp_transport.py (tested, zero importers) and from claim.sh
# (#74, wired the same day it landed) is that a tool with no caller is a
# documentation rule with a binary attached.
#
# The load-bearing test here is `a failed worktree aborts the dispatch`: if
# worktree.sh new fails and the brief goes out anyway, the lane works in the
# shared checkout, which IS #73. Sending nothing is the correct outcome.

# agent-dotfiles#174: dispatch.sh now READS the ledger to pick a lane, where
# before this suite was written it only ever WROTE to it (#140, nothing read
# it back). Every case in this file that dispatches to lane t:3 under the
# implicit default state dir used to be independent BY ACCIDENT -- nothing
# read the previous case's leftover ledger row, so it did not matter that
# they shared one. Now it would: a second dispatch to t:3 under a ledger that
# still shows the first one's task open would be correctly refused as
# occupied, breaking every case below that expects a second dispatch to
# succeed under the SAME implicit state dir. Each call gets an UNSHARED
# default state dir via `mktemp`, so every case that has not opted into a
# shared one via LEDGER_STATE keeps testing exactly what it tested before
# this landed -- one dispatch, in isolation. Cases that explicitly set
# LEDGER_STATE (to inspect what a specific dispatch recorded, or to force a
# broken ledger) are unaffected; they never relied on the implicit default.
#
# `mktemp -d`, not a counter: `run()` is almost always called as
# `out=$(run ...)`, and command substitution forks a SUBSHELL -- a counter
# variable incremented inside `run()` would increment only that subshell's
# copy and never advance in the parent, so every call would compute the same
# "next" value. `mktemp` needs no shared, persistent state to stay unique.

# --- A LEDGER *WRITE* FAILURE STILL DOES NOT ABORT A DISPATCH -------------
#
# #140's original property, narrowed by #174 rather than dropped: once a lane
# is ALREADY known free (so step 1 needed no write of its own -- see the
# lane-free command's docstring), a dispatch proceeds through claim, worktree
# and a real, verified send before step 6 ever touches the ledger again. If
# THAT final write fails, the brief has already reached a live pane; unwinding
# the claim and the worktree at that point would strand a worker that is
# actually running, which is worse than one stale ledger row. See step 6's
# own comment for the full argument.
#
# The break is deliberately an APPLICATION-level conflict, not a filesystem
# one: a task already exists under the exact id this dispatch's window name
# will produce (`ad148-ledger-write-broken`), assigned to a DIFFERENT lane.
# `Ledger.record_dispatch`'s own assign step refuses that outright (agent-
# dotfiles#144 finding 2's docstring). A read-only sqlite file was tried
# first and dropped: whether SQLite's WAL machinery lets a given read
# through after the main file is chmod'd read-only turned out to depend on
# per-process lock/checkpoint state and was not deterministic across
# separate `cli.py` invocations -- exactly the kind of flake this suite
# should not carry. Reads (step 0, step 1) are untouched by this seed; only

# then aborted, is worse than no record: the entire point of the ledger is to
# be believed. The guarantee is ordering, not cleanup -- the write happens
# after the last abort path -- so this asserts no TASK is ever recorded,
# which is what "busy" actually means to `lane_available` (agent-dotfiles#174:
# `lanes":[]` no longer holds here on its own -- step 1's lane selection runs
# BEFORE the claim and the worktree, and its first-sight backfill legitimately
# registers a never-seen `free-N` lane as free while deciding whether to use
# it, whether or not the rest of the dispatch goes on to succeed. That row
# says free, truthfully, and free is not the claim this test guards against.

# --- agent-dotfiles#184: two dispatchers racing the SAME candidate lane ---
#
# Every case above dispatches once, in isolation -- the second dispatcher
# never exists. #184 is specifically about what happens when it does: two
# dispatchers can both read `lanes.sh --free` + `cli.py lane-free` and see
# the SAME lane free before either one finishes acting on it. A test that
# only calls dispatch.sh twice IN SEQUENCE proves nothing (the second call
# losing is what happens either way) -- this drives dispatcher A into the
# stub, splices a WHOLE second dispatch (dispatcher B, for a different
# issue, against the real unmodified dispatch.sh) in via a test-only hook
# right after A reads the lane free and before A can act on that read, and
# only then lets A continue. That is "dispatcher A reads availability, then
# B completes a whole dispatch, then A sends" -- #184's own required shape,
# not two calls back to back.
#
# DISPATCH_TEST_RACE_HOOK is dispatch.sh's only concession to this: a command
# run with the candidate lane as $1, at exactly the point a second dispatcher
# would need to land a competing dispatch to prove the race. No caller sets

# releases its lane claim. #209 is about the paths it cannot enumerate: a
# `kill`, an OOM, a closed terminal, a host crash. The placeholder
# `claim_lane` writes is a task with status `created`, and `lane_available`
# counts any non-terminal status as occupied -- so a dispatcher that dies
# holding one leaves the lane reading occupied with nothing working it. That
# is agent-dotfiles#102's failure shape (dispatch capacity silently falling to
# zero while lanes sit idle) reached through the mechanism built to prevent
# it, and it was hand-reconciled nine times in two days before this test
# existed.
#
# The kill is delivered by standing in for `python3` (DISPATCH_PYTHON, which
# dispatch.sh already reads) and signalling the DISPATCHER the instant its
# claim has committed -- the exact instant the gap opens. No new seam in
# dispatch.sh, and the victim is named by the `--owner-pid` argument the claim

# --- agent-dotfiles#209 round 2: the point of no return is the SEND -------
#
# Every case above signals the dispatcher right after `claim-lane`, which is
# the EARLIEST instant the claim exists -- nothing has been typed, no lane has
# been renamed, and freeing the claim there is correct. None of them signals
# after the brief is live, and that absence is what let the first round of
# this fix ship with the cleanup pointed at the wrong instant.
#
# The re-review's measurement: the trap and the reap both treated
# `CLAIM_COMMITTED` (set after step 5's confirmation loop) as the point of no
# return, but the brief goes live ~70 lines earlier, at the `send-keys Enter`
# that submits it -- up to DISPATCH_CONFIRM_TRIES x DISPATCH_SETTLE (10s by
# default) of wall clock in between. A signal landing in that window ran the
# trap and deleted the claim AFTER the lane had been renamed and the brief
# submitted, and `lane_available` then answered True for a lane that was
# actively working. #102/#126's failure shape produced by the cleanup instead
# of prevented by it, which dispatch.sh's own step 6 comment says in its own
# words must not happen.
#
# So the commit point is now the ledger fact `commit-lane-claim` writes
# IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that Enter, and the two assertions below are about the
# same instant from the two sides that can reach it: a trappable signal
# (SIGTERM, the trap runs) and an untrappable one (SIGKILL, only the reap
# runs). Both must leave the lane HELD.

# WHY: on 2026-08-12 the review of #204 was dispatched to lane 4, the same
# lane that had written the code under review (ad193/ad204), and its APPROVE
# had to be thrown away and a second review dispatched. The fix is
# `--reviews-pr`: the caller names which PR is under review, and dispatch.sh
# resolves that PR's authoring task from the ledger -- never from a window
# name -- and refuses to hand it back to its own author.
#
# Two free lanes this time (t:3 and t:4), so there is a genuine choice to
# make: skipping the author must land on the OTHER free lane, not just fail.
