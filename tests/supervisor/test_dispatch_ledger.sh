# The ledger, not the tmux window name, decides whether `dispatch.sh` may use

# Its a tool not a database." This file exercises the five tests #174 itself
# names, plus the mutation check it names: a `dispatch.sh` that falls back
# to the window name on a ledger miss must make test 2 go red.
#
# test_dispatch.sh already covers the surrounding dispatch mechanics (claim,
# worktree, message delivery, the #140 write-tolerance) end to end and is not
# repeated here. This file is narrowly about one question: who decides a
# lane is free.
